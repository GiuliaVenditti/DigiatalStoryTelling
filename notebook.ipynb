    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Digitization, as one of the key outcomes of technological growth, has led to profound changes in entertainment, and therefore in the world of cinema, as well as in many other areas. As a result, the distribution and broadcasting strategy that Netflix brought to the market turned into an amazing success story in a very short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix's strategy is based on the idea that consumers can access the platform's entire content catalog for a monthly price. In addition, Netflix only broadcasts its films on the web, with no theatrical or limited distribution. The approach, which is vastly different from the classic idea of ​​the Hollywood studio system, has led to significant advances for audiences, directors and studios in various ways. In this way, we can confidently say that streaming services, such as Netflix, are influencing the film industry in terms of how we access movies, what material we consume and how movies are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime gain more users thanks to competitive prices compared to movie theaters, and recommendation algorithms. The latter play an important role in the dissemination of romantic comedies and thrillers, obtaining some success thanks to the data of millions of users who use them. This dominant position places Internet platforms in a strong position in terms of film content. In the future, that authority could be key in determining what constitutes a \"well-made film\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of Internet streaming services on filmmakers has been one of the most important transformations in the world of cinema in recent years. The promise of a more open environment for filmmakers than other large studios has attracted numerous directors to the platforms, with huge ramifications in the world of cinema. Furthermore, the fact that these services have less stringent standards than cinemas makes them attractive to producers. Another important aspect concerns independent directors. Since the 1980s, when Hollywood became the hub of cinema and blockbuster films began to dominate theaters, it has been difficult for independent directors to reach large audiences. Cinemas often prefer high-budget movies as they can make a much larger profit from them. As a result, independent films have few opportunities outside of film festivals to date. However, with internet streaming services becoming a major role in the world of cinema, independent filmmakers now have the opportunity to reach a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to investigate, through data, how streaming platforms have changed film production. is the world of production really fairer? How much power does the user of these platforms have?"
