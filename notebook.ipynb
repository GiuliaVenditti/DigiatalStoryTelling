    "\n",
    "Digitization, as one of the key outcomes of technological growth, has led to deep changes in entertainment, and therefore in the world of cinema, as well as in many other socio-economical areas. As a result, the distribution and broadcasting strategy, that Netflix brought to the market, turned into an amazing success story in a very short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix's strategy is based on the idea that consumers can access the platform's entire content catalog for a monthly price. Additionally, Netflix only broadcasts its films on the web, with no theatrical or limited distribution. This approach, which is vastly different from the classic idea of ​​the Hollywood studio system, has led to advances for audiences, directors and studios in various directions. In this way, we can say that streaming services, such as Netflix, are influencing the film industry in terms of how we access movies, what material we consume and how movies are made. Their dominant position, places Internet platforms in a strong decisional position in terms of film content. In the future, this kind of authority could be key in determining what constitutes a \"well-made film\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of Internet streaming services on filmmakers has been one of the most important transformations in the show business in recent years. The promise of a more open environment for filmmakers than other large studios has attracted numerous directors to the platforms, with huge ramifications in the world of cinema. Furthermore, the fact that these services have less stringent standards than cinemas makes them attractive to producers. Another important aspect concerns independent directors. Since the 1980s, when Hollywood became the hub of cinema and blockbuster films began to dominate theaters, it has been difficult for independent directors to reach large audiences. Cinemas often prefer high-budget movies as they can make a much larger profit from them. As a result, independent films have few opportunities outside of film festivals to date. However, with internet streaming services becoming a major role in the world of cinema, independent filmmakers now have the opportunity to reach a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to investigate, through data, how streaming platforms have changed film production. is the world of production really fairer? "

We singularize duration information that were expressed with 'Serie', 'Series' and 'min' values to keep only 'Serie' and 'min' values.

    "**Conclusion:** From the two plot we notice that male directors are still the majority. Interestingly, after 2014 (the year of the real boom of streaming services), female directors have seen an increase. But, in the same year the male directors also had an exponential growth. Are we really achieving a gender balance in the world of cinema, or are we simply producing more content in less time?"

    "# How streaming services treats their content? \n",
    "To undertand how streaming services deal with their contents we first analyse how they add contents on the platforms. We start from an hystory overview to then get deep on month addition habiths. Then we explore which genre they add during the year and if there is some trand for each month. Because genre is associated by the streaming platform we analyse how Amazon and Netflix register their content looking to genre co-occurrence. Finaly we investigate how old are movies and which national film culture is more represented by the two company. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Year added\n",
    "We plot two line chart one for Netflix and one for Amazon to investigate movement by year in content type and quantity addition. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:** Netflix and Amazon act in different ways in matter of content addition. If on one heand Netflix appear to have an increase of contents addition after 2014, on the other heand, Amazon seems to be more constant but it show less offer. Both the streaming services have a down trand after 2020, probably due to Covid-19 pandemic.\n",
    "Both servicies peak global content amount was in 2019. It appears that Netflix has focused more attention on increasing Movie content that TV Shows. Movies have increased much more dramatically than TV shows. Amazon on the contrary always hade more attention to Movie than Tv Shows but in 2021 there is an invertion of the trand. During this year Amazon incrase tv shows content more than the movie ones."

    "Until 2019, content not released in theaters could not participate in many major competitions, including the Oscars.\n",
    "To understand the correlation of distributor and prize we use a heat map. Then, we draw a histogram showing the award and nomination ammount divided by distributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** \n",
    "Of the movies on streaming platforms, Netflix and Amazon appear to have won the most generic awards, but they don't score as high in the most popular awards. Content on the platform is more likely to win a Primetime Emmy among well-known awards. There are few films that have won Oscars, most of which have been distributed by Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures. Proportionately, the films distributed by the platforms do not tend to be nominated for awards, the most acclaimed coming from the TV broadcasters. We will probably have to wait a few years to see any substantial changes."

    "Finally we focus on the audience. Streaming services link how people watch movies. Let's compare 1) iMDb audience figures, great for gathering general public opinon, with 2) Rotten Tomatoes, a platform that takes care of simplifying the opinions of critics. In this way we believe can get an idea, if the films on streaming platforms are more appreciated by the public/critics, and we are able to explore the evolution of the trend over time. Finally, to give more context to our data, we build a scatter chart where the points are the titles positioned on the year of release, sorted by public opinion but forgotten by critical opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conlusion:** Older content has higher Rotten Tomatoes than iMDB Reating. It is interesting that in 1960 there was a dramatic drop in Rotten Tomatoes, but public opinion seems almost unchanged. Exploring the scatterplot we note that the result is caused by an outlier: G.I Blues, one of the worst Rotten Tomatoes scored films (has score 0), but at the same time rated with 68 points by the audienc, that may fancy the Pop icon Elvis Preslei, the protagonist of the film. Similarly, the trend of Rotten Tomatoes decreases compared to iMDb reating in 1995 and 2014, years of the internet explosion; and then it normalizes in 2008, the year in which streaming services appeared."
