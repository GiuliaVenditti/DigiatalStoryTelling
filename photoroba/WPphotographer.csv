0,A New Age of Walls team,none,"In the United States, Donald Trump’s call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border was a central theme to his campaign for presidency. In response, The Washington Post assembled a small team to investigate the complex socio-economic ramifications of the phenomenon of governments erecting barriers.

	Samuel Granados, senior graphics editor, led the team effort to create a digital story that would provide high-level analysis of the global trend while also conveying the emotional human experiences on both sides of border walls. Zoeann Murphy, a video journalist who spent more than a decade documenting refugees and migration issues, led the video and photography components of the project. Kevin Schaul, an award-winning visual journalist, reported and built the backend of the pioneering new storytelling platform, where the user can smoothly scroll through interwoven video, text, and graphics. Berlin bureau chief Anthony Faiola added extensive experience reporting on globalization and writing. The team worked closely for several months on both the narrative and the design of the platform.

	The project was a close collaboration between The Washington Post’s graphics, video, and foreign desks. Kat Downs, graphics director, is at the forefront of interaction design and pushed the project to use advanced metrics analysis to better understanding user behavior. Reem Akkad, senior producer of video, had worked on dozens of documentaries and oversaw the video editing. The Washington Post’s foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, brought to the project the talent and vision of his international teams, including reporting from Anthony Faiola and Stephanie Kirchner in Europe, Joshua Partlow in Mexico, and William Booth and Ruth Eglash in Israel.","{'Zoeann Murphy', 'Reem Akkad', 'Douglas Jehl', 'Samuel Granados', 'Donald Trump’s', 'Stephanie Kirchner', 'William Booth', 'Ruth Eglash', 'Kevin Schaul', 'Anthony Faiola', 'Joshua Partlow', 'Kat Downs'}",12,"{'The Washington Post’s', 'The Washington Post'}",2,"{'Berlin', 'Israel', 'Mexico', 'US', 'the United States'}",5

He quit, and set off around Australia with a surfboard and a Nikon F3 that his uncle—also a photographer—had passed down. Fate further intervened a week into the trip when his van was broken into. Everything but his well-hidden camera, and surfboard, which he was riding at the time, was stolen. 30,000KM later, he enrolled in the Sydney Institute of TAFE's Photography program, finishing at the top of his class in 2004. He was given an informal internship at Fairfax Media which evolved into full-time employment. There, Quilty found himself surrounded by some of Australia's most outstanding photographers. They reshaped his worldview and set him on a course that continues to inspire his work today. He left Fairfax in 2010 and freelanced from Sydney before relocating to New York City in 2012. But it was during a trip to Afghanistan and the Middle East, in 2013, that he first discovered bonafide purpose and fulfilment in his photography. He has been based in Kabul, Afghanistan ever since. His work in Afghanistan has been published worldwide and garnered several awards. He has travelled to more than 20 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces and continues to document the country through pictures and, increasingly, the written word.

Andy also turned his curious photojournalist’s eye to his native country, embarking on a series of projects dedicated to crime in Calabria, the vocation of young priests, and velinismo (TV showgirl culture as a shortcut to “fame” despite its casual objectification of women). His photographs have been used by some of the most important international publications. Andy Rocchelli was killed on 24 May in the city of Sloviansk, eastern Ukraine, where he was covering the clashes between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army.

197,Anton Corbijn,none,"It has been more than 40 years since Anton Corbijn, born 1955 in Strijen, discovered photography though his love for music while still at high school in Holland.  He used his father’s camera for his first photos at an open-air concert in 1972. He soon moved from stage photography to portrait photography, but initially only of musicians.  Anton Corbijn moved to London in 1979 to follow his love of music from there and is today widely regarded as one of the most influential photographers both in the world of music and in the world of portraiture photography. An autodidact, he has changed his approach to photography a few times over the years but kept relatively close to his first subject matter: artists in general and specifically musicians.  Some of his most well known photographs feature; Clint Eastwood, Cameron Diaz, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, Naomi Campbell, William S. Burroughs, Tom Waits, Allen Ginsberg, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Robert De Niro, Gerhard Richter, Ai Weiwei, Lucian Freud and is considered to be the ‘house’ photographer of U2 for the last 30 odd years and for Depeche Mode for almost as long. Anton Corbijn is very interested in pushing the boundaries in respect to the media he works in.  He has been working in film and video with some of the musicians he photographed and was in 1983 one of the first photographers to direct music videos. He has since made approximately 80 music videos; for among others U2, Johnny Cash, Arcade Fire, Depeche Mode, Nirvana, Metallica, Nick Cave, Coldplay and The Killers. He also made in 1993 a short film with and about Don van Vliet a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, called “Some Yo Yo Stuff”. His music video work is highly acclaimed and has won him an MTV award for Nirvana’s “Heart Shaped Box”, and a CADS (Creative and Design Awards) award for “outstanding achievement” for his oeuvre in 2005. A Directors series DVD was released by Palm Pictures in the same year. Since 1990, apart from working in photography and video, Anton also worked with graphic design to create logos, posters and CD covers.  Although not conventionally trained in graphic design, he has found his style by painting his own typeface. That way he successfully designed posters and record sleeves for artists like Herbert Grönemeyer and Depeche Mode and designed the logo for the Dutch city The Hague. Anton Corbijn’s exhibitions have been extremely successful in Europe and his work can be seen in museums and galleries alike as well as in 15 published books. His most recent book WAITS/CORBIJN, which was collaboration between Anton and Tom Waits, was sold out from the publisher within a week of publication. In addition his work can be seen on over 100 record/CD sleeves featuring artists like U2, R.E.M., The Bee Gees, Morrissey, The Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker, Bryan Ferry, The Killers, Bruce Springsteen, James Last, JJ Cale, Nick Cave, Depeche Mode and Metallica.  For Depeche Mode he has designed stage-sets as well as the on-stage visuals for all their world tours for the last 20 years. In 2005 Anton Corbijn started working on (directing/co-producing/financing) his first feature film “CONTROL”, which was filmed during the summer of 2006, and released in October 2007.  It was his most ambitious projects to date and a further extension to his versatile artistic career.  The film is a love story about the life, and death, of Ian Curtis, who was Joy Division’s singer.  This subject was very close to Anton’s heart as Joy Division was the reason for why he’d moved from Holland to London as he “wanted to be closer to where their music came from”.  “CONTROL” and Anton as a director won around 20 awards worldwide, including 5 BIFA’s, one of those for Sam Riley as the lead actor. Anton Corbijn has in recent years worked on a new series of portraits of painters, directed a second feature film called “The American” with George Clooney in the lead which occupied the #1 spot in the USA in 2010.  His third feature called “A Most Wanted Man”, based on the novel by John Le Carré featuring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, premiered at the Sundance Festival in 2014, and is as of September 2014 released world-wide to largely amazingly positive reviews.  “LIFE” a feature with Robert Pattinson shot in Canada & USA early last year is due to premiere at this year’s Berlinale. Anton has recently also managed to direct a few commercials i.e. Miss Dior, Volvo and a Depeche Mode live DVD and shot several features for Vogue (USA).  In 2011 he was awarded the highest Dutch Cultural Award, the ‘Prince Bernhard Cultuurfonds Prijs’, for his contribution and influence in the world of the arts. 2015 is set to be a busy year, with several large museums shows scheduled for travel across Europe as a celebration of Anton’s long career.","{'Robert Pattinson', 'Cameron Diaz', 'Metallica', 'Allen Ginsberg', 'Gerhard Richter', 'Nick Cave', 'Lucian Freud', 'John Le Carré', 'Ai Weiwei', 'George Clooney', 'Herbert Grönemeyer', 'Tom Waits', 'David Bowie', 'Clint Eastwood', 'Anton Corbijn', 'Sam Riley', 'Anton', 'Don van Vliet', 'Nirvana', 'Beefheart', 'Depeche Mode', 'Joni Mitchell', 'John Lee Hooker', 'Johnny Cash', 'Bryan Ferry', 'William S.

202,Antonio Gibotta,Italy,"It's a means of expression. He loves traveling and searching for stories. Foreign cultures make him curious. He often looks, and takes pictures, of the poor and outcast in order to sensitize people who often look at them with contempt. He wants to spread the sense of solidarity. Some of the reality he's seen, like in South America, Africa, India, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and Europe, has changed his mind and values. He says he's become much more grateful for his life and its gifts. In recent years, he has exhibited in New York, France, China, Brussels, and Italy. He has also won many awards, including FIOF, Pictures of the Year International and World Press Photo. In October 2014, the National Geographic put a photograph of his in the book Stunning Photographs and two years later, in 2016, his story was one of the 21 multimedia stories presented at the 5th LUMIX Festival for Young Photojournalism in Germany.

212,Arild Kristo,Norway,"Arild Kristo (1939-2010) was a Norwegian photographer and filmmaker, whose small but poignant oeuvre achieved cult status as time passed, encompassing 180 photos, two short films and one feature film. Kristo had his photographic education in the Unites States and worked as a freelance photographer in the U.S. and Europe. In 1962, together with photographers Dan Young (1938) and Robert A. Robinson (1927-1996), he founded photo agency Manité, a name taken from the French word Humanité, which referred to the fundamental idea behind the group's photographic approach: to capture human existence through photography.  Kristo travelled around Europe in 1962. When he came back, he discovered on his negatives a little boy playing in the shadow of the newly erected Berlin Wall. He decided to return in 1963 to make a story about this boy, Manfred Stein, and his life near Checkpoint Charlie. The photo essay about Manfred was published in the American magazine Look in June 1963 and in British and German magazines as well. In 1963, Kristo created the photo series Ten Commandments, in which he used distinct cropping methods, high contrasts and remarkable typography to present his images. Arild Kristo made his debut as a film director in 1966 with the short film Undergrunnen (The Underground) about Oslo's subway. In 1967, he followed with Kristoball, a playful film about a young director's anguishes and problems. Kristo's only feature film Eddie & Suzanne (1974) is a road movie about a Norwegian Romeo and Juliet in the 1970s.","{'Berlin Wall', 'Robert A.

It was November 12, 1964, in Port-au Prince. The Haitian government canceled school and people were bussed in from miles around to watch the execution of Louis Drouin and Marcel Numa. The two young men were the last two survivors of a 13-member group that called themselves ‘Jeune Haiti' (Young Haiti). The group had planned to overthrow the regime of Francois ‘Papa Doc' Duvalier. The next day, a photographer who had shot the rebels' deaths frame by frame posted them in the front of his studio. It was a gruesome sight for the young Morel, but it made him realize that he wanted to take pictures too. For over 20 years, Morel has documented his native country, capturing culture, history and people - covering coups d'état, numerous presidents, ceremonies and pilgrimages, demonstrations and massacres, hurricanes or harvests. His photographs have appeared in  The New York Times, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal and throughout the world.

So far she has curated Subjective/Objective, and Under the Bridge, for the NY PhotoFestival, and New Yorker Fiction/Real Photography, at the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea. In the fall of 2011, her exhibition Beyond Words: Photography in The New Yorker, was the season’s opening show at the Howard Greenberg Gallery. It has been expanded and traveled to the Ullens Center in Beijing. Currently, Biondi’s exhibition Widely Different: New York City Panoramas, is on view at the Seaport Museum, in New York.

	Born and educated in Germany, Biondi started working with photography when Geo magazine made its appearance on the American market. Although the magazine won many awards for its photography and design, it ultimately ceased publication in 1984. Subsequently, Biondi moved to Vanity Fair. As director of photography, she focused on lively, witty portraiture—an important contribution to the increased success of the publication. After seven years at Vanity Fair, Biondi returned to Germany to work for Stern. As head of the photography department, she explored the fast-paced world of news and reportage photography, and worked with photographers from around the world. 

	In 1996, Biondi returned to New York to join The New Yorker, shortly after photography was introduced to the magazine, and as it began to play a more prominent editorial role. As visuals editor she helped shape the look of the publication by establishing a group of staff photographers, commissioning both well-known photographers and emerging talent, and utilizing portrait, fine art, and documentary photography. She built a strong reputation for The New Yorker’s use of photography, and the magazine received numerous awards, including two National Magazine Awards.

	Biondi is also a senior thesis adviser for SVA Graduate School, and is a contributing editor for Aperture and Fantôme magazines. She has sat on the World Press Photo contest jury on two previous occasions, and was a master for the Joop Swart Masterclass in 1995.","{'Biondi', 'Howard Greenberg Gallery', 'Beyond Words', 'Elisabeth Biondi', 'Stern'}",5,"{'National Magazine Awards', 'the World Press Photo', 'Subjective/Objective', 'Biondi', 'The New Yorker', 'New Yorker Fiction/Real Photography', 'Vanity Fair', 'the Seaport Museum', 'SVA Graduate School', 'Chelsea', 'the NY PhotoFestival', 'The New Yorker’s'}",12,"{'Germany', 'Beijing', 'Fantôme', 'New York City Panoramas', 'New York'}",5

669,Esther Horvath,Hungary,"Esther Horvath is a documentary photographer, Fellow at the International League of Conservation Photographers, member of The Photo Society and a science photographer for Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany.

Horvath wants to show the full research story behind our climate data: who the scientists that are delivering crucial climate change information are, and how they work and live in the most remote locations and harshest environments on the planet.

Since 2015, after her first assignment in the Arctic Ocean with Audubon Magazine, Horvath has dedicated her photography to the polar regions, especially to the Arctic Ocean, documenting scientific expeditions and behind the scene science stories. She follows the work of multiple science groups that are working to better understand the changing polar regions. By documenting the work and life of scientists who deliver important data, Horvath hopes to help make a difference in how people understand what is actually occurring and, in collaboration with scientists, help raise public awareness regarding these fragile environments.

Begun in 2016, her main long-term documentary project IceBird has followed scientific expeditions investigating the thinning ice cover in the Arctic Ocean.

From 2019 - 2020, she spent almost four months on board the Polarstern icebreaker, documenting the MOSAiC expedition in the Central Arctic Ocean, the largest ever Arctic Ocean science expedition. Her documentary, during polar nights, under the extreme conditions of the North Pole is published in the book Into the Arctic Ice. The book, accompanied by essays and contributions by experts, is a testimony to the biggest climatic challenge of our time, and offers insights into this research project as well as the polar landscape worthy of protection.

Horvath’s work has been featured in National Geographic, The New York Times, Audubon Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, TIME, GEO and Stern among others.

832,Goran Tomasevic,Serbia,"Tomasevic's award-winning pictures of wars and revolutions have become some of the most enduring images of the conflicts fought in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. His broad work includes photographic features from South Sudan, Pakistan, Mozambique, DR Congo Central African Republic, Burundi, Nigeria and sports coverage of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. After photographing the wars that followed the break-up of former Yugoslavia for a local paper, in 1996 Tomasevic joined Reuters, covering the simmering political tensions in Kosovo and the anti-Milosevic demonstrations in his hometown of Belgrade. During NATO's three-month bombardment of Serbia in 1999, Tomasevic was the only photographer working for foreign press to spend the duration of the conflict in Kosovo. Tomasevic moved to Jerusalem in 2002, covering the second Palestinian intifada. During the U.S. led invasions of Iraq in 2003, his picture of a U.S. Marine watching the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue became one of the most memorable images of the war. He often returned to Iraq as sectarian violence escalated and regularly photographed America's other war in Afghanistan. His sequence of photographs of U.S. Marine Sergeant Bee narrowly escaping Taliban bullets became an iconic image in U.S. war history. Tomasevic moved to Cairo in 2006 and was at the heart of Reuters' coverage of the Arab Springs. In Libya, his image of a fireball that spewed up after an air strike on pro Gaddafi fighters became an iconic image of the Libyan war, gracing the front pages of more than 100 newspapers around the globe. Tomasevic's raw pictures of rebel fighters battling pro-Assad forces among the ruins of Aleppo and Damascus have won international acclaim, as did his coverage of the bloody siege on a Nairobi shopping mall in Kenya. Tomasevic's work has been recognised with many prestigious international awards. He has been named Reuters Photographer of the Year a record four times (2003, 2005, 2011 and 2013) and won the Reuters' Photograph of the Year award in 2008. In 2014, he was awarded first prize in the Spot News Stories category at the World Press Photo and second and third prize ""News Picture Story"" at POYi. He won China International Press Photo of the Year in 2011 and he has been awarded for a spot news in 2004 and 2012. In 2009 he won the SOPA Award of Excellence for News Photography. In 2012 Tomasevic won the London Frontline Club Award and in 2013 the Days Japan award. In 2005 he got the National Press Photography Association, Best of Photojournalism in the Portrait and Personality category and third place for news in 2011. In 2014 he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography. The Guardian's photo team chose Goran Tomasevic as their agency photographer of the year for 2013. International Business Times UK chose Goran as their agency photographer of the year for 2016. In 2012 the Czech Photo Gallery in Prague held a six-week exhibition of Tomasevic's war photography, depicting more than two decades of conflict. Further exhibitions were held in Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents Club in 2014 and Perpignan, France during the Visa pour l’Image festival in 2006, 2013 and 2015.

Guy began pursuing long term personal documentary projects while studying at Newport, one of which, ‘Trading over the Borderline’- a documentation of the border region between Turkey and Northern Iraq and its trade routes – won him the Guardian and Observer Hodge Award for young photographers. Inspired by regions that are in periods of transition, he went on to pursue a long term project on the re- birth of the Cossack movement and Russian nationalism in Southern Russia and the Caucasus from 2005 to 2007, which culminated in the documentation of the Russian/Georgia conflict in August 2008. From January 2011 he began to document the revolutions sweeping through the Middle East and North Africa, photographing the revolution in Egypt before documenting the civil war in Libya from the east to the besieged western city of Misrata in April 2011. His work has appeared in the Guardian, Observer, Sunday Times, The Daily Telegraph, Der Spiegel, D Magazine, FADER Magazine, Monocle Magazine, Huck Magazine, The British Journal of Photography, ARTWORLD, The NewStatesman, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Newsweek Japan, Harpers, Le Monde Dagens Næringsliv - D2/Magasinet and Time.  In 2011 he became an associate lecturer in Press and Editorial Photography program at the University of Falmouth, UK. In 2012 his work from Egypt and Libya formed the basis for joint exhibitions at the Spanish Cultural Centre in New York, HOST Gallery in London, the Third Floor Gallery in Cardiff and the SIDE Gallery in Newcastle. He had his first solo show “Shifting Sands” at the Poly Gallery in Falmouth in January 2012. His work on Libya’s missing formed the basis for a newspaper print book published by HerePress and was distributed for free on the London Underground tube network.  Since 2012 he has been based in Istanbul Turkey, where he is beginning a new long term project on the ebb and flow of Turkish power and influence. Frustrated by the limitations, preconceptions and cliché’s that confront photographers working in the middle east, Guy began a long term look into how blending work from the scenes of soap operas, and the daily violent struggle for the streets of Istanbul can work and interact with one another. The first part of this project, “City of Dreams” chapters 1 & 2 were exhibited as part of the 2nd PhotoReporter Festival in St.Brieuc, France in October 2013 – it has also been selected as a finalist entry in the Sony World Photography Awards 2014 and won the 2nd FIPCOMM award for economic stories 2014.

Apart from working on personal projects, Ore does commissioned work for international publications such as Bloomberg, Le Monde newspaper, M magazine and Getty Images, as well as for NGOs and corporate clients. Since 2010, Ore’s photographic works have been exhibited in photo festivals, museums and galleries regionally and internationally. She was named one of the 10 Platform Emerging Photographers in Singapore in 2010 and was selected to participate in the 1st Asian Women Photographers’ Showcase in Angkor Photo Festival. She was nominated for the Sagamihara Photo City’s Asia Prize (Japan) and received a Select Award in the Kuala Lumpur International Photo Award.

At first, he made short movies, but the power of the still image gripped him more. Eventually, photojournalism—particularly that exploring the human aspect in a story—became his main focus.
	 
	During the 1980s, Dago continued with photography, while working at a variety of jobs, from serving in a camera shop to cleaning slaughterhouses at night. As his work improved, he became an assistant in an advertising photography studio. In 1990, he became an apprentice at Jyllands-Posten, and worked at the newspaper for the next five years. In 1994, Dago turned freelance, in order to concentrate on more in-depth projects, returning to work as a newspaper staff photographer after ten years.

His work, The Boys from Ramallah and The Boys from Hebron, covers both sides of the Intifada expressed through the lives of children coming of age amidst the violence. Grarup’s work takes the viewer to the limits of human despair, dignity, suffering and hope. His images are relevant to us all, because they form a chronicle of the time in which we live, but at times do not dare to recognize. Grarup has been honored with many of the most prestigious awards from the photography industry and human rights organizations, including: Eight World Press Photo awards, UNICEF, W. Eugene Smith Foundation for Humanistic Photography, Oskar Barnack award,  POYi and NPPA. In 2005, he was awarded with a Visa d’Or at the Visa Pour l’Image photo festival in France, for his coverage of Darfur’s refugee crisis.

From 1990 to 1994 he covered the transition in South Africa from apartheid to democracy. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kadir covered social issues in different corners of the former empire. In 1997 he embarked on a big project to travel along the seven rivers of the world, from source to mouth, covering daily life along these lifelines. The project resulted in the book ‘Rivers’ and ‘Aderen’ (Mets & Schilt). Kadir has received numerous prizes and awards in photojournalism. In 2000 and 2002 Kadir was a jury member of the World Press Photo contest and is currently on the supervisory board of the World Press Photo foundation. In 2004 he went back to Angola, Sierra Leone and the DR of Congo to portray the diamond industry, following the diamonds from the mines to the consumer markets in the western world. The resulting exhibitions were shown in Europe and the USA, and also in the mining areas of Congo, Angola and Sierra Leone. The photo book ‘Diamond Matters, the diamond industry’ was published by Mets & Schilt (Holland), Dewi Lewis (UK) and Umbrage editions (USA) and awarded the prestigious Dutch Dick Scherpenzeel Prize for best reporting on the developing world. The project was also recognized with a World Press Photo Award. In that same year, Kadir initiated a photo project together with Stanley Greene and six other photographers on the issue of violence against women around the world. Following hurricane Katrina he made several trips to the USA to document the aftermath of the storm. In the summer of 2010, to mark the fifth commemoration of Hurricane Katrina, Kadir exhibited images of Katrina’s devastation and the aftermath in a truck-exhibition that drove from Houston to New Orleans, a project in collaboration with Stanley Greene. From 2011 to 2012, Kadir created Via PanAm; a visual investigation on migration in the Americas. He spent 12 months travelling along the Pan American Highway from Terra del Fuego in Patagonia to Deadhorse in Northern Alaska. Originally made as an interactive application for the iPad, Via PanAm was also made into a traveling interactive multimedia based exhibition, installation and a book. With the project ‘Where will we go’, Kadir looked at the global consequences of rising sea levels caused by climate change. The project is designed to highlight both the immense complexities associated with in-island and inter-island/country movement, and the human rights implications involved in such displacements. Kadir is a frequent lecturer and photography teacher and is based in Amsterdam.","{'Via PanAm', 'Kadir', 'Dewi Lewis', 'Stanley Greene'}",4,"{'Umbrage', 'Sierra Leone', 'the World Press Photo', 'iPad', 'the Pan American Highway', 'the DR of Congo', 'Terra del Fuego', 'Mets & Schilt'}",8,"{'Sierra Leone', 'Holland', 'Congo', 'UK', 'Kadir', 'South Africa', 'Patagonia', 'the Soviet Union', 'Liberia', 'USA', 'Amsterdam', 'Houston', 'New Orleans', 'Angola', 'Mozambique'}",15

After finishing high school in 1996, Hossaini joined the Iranian reformist movement as a political activist. After a while, he realized that he should be recording the historical events that were going on around him, and chose photography as the means of doing so.

	As a refugee himself, it was too difficult and dangerous to risk photographing in the streets of Iran, so he decided to focus on fellow Afghans sheltering in Iran. He was documenting the life of refugees in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city, when the events of 11 September 2001 changed his direction completely. Hossaini decided to go back to Afghanistan, at the beginning of 2002, where he joined Aina, an organization aimed at training people in media and communication skills, founded by National Geographic Fellow and photojournalist, Reza Deghati. He learned his photography skills from Reza’s brother, Manoocher Deghati, and was soon being given professional assignments. Hossaini joined Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2007, and covered the war in Afghanistan, part of the time embedded with US troops. In doing this, he traveled to isolated villages, where he also documented local life. Hossaini’s work has twice been exhibited in Berlin, and he is currently still an AFP photographer in Afghanistan.","{'Reza Deghati', 'Massoud Hossaini', 'Manoocher Deghati', 'Aina', 'Hossaini'}",5,"{'National Geographic Fellow', 'AFP', 'Agence France-Presse'}",3,"{'Berlin', 'US', 'Mashhad', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran'}",6

1516,Max Pam,Australia,"Max Pam is passionate about life, travel and photography -- for him they are inseparable. Travel has been the catalyst for the creation of his compelling images since the 1960s and the images he has produced providing an intimate journal of his life. As a teenager Pam found post-war suburban Melbourne grim, oppressive and culturally isolated. He found refuge in the counter-culture of surfing and the imagery of National Geographic and Surfer magazine and became determined to travel overseas.  Pam left Australia at 20, after accepting a job as a photographer assisting an astrophysicist. Together, the pair drove a Volkswagen from Calcutta to London. This adventure proved inspirational and travel has remained a crucial and continuous link to Pam's creative and personal development. Pam's work takes the viewer on compelling journeys around the globe.  His extensive work in Asian counties is well represented in major collections and books as are his travels in Europe and Australia and into the rich and diverse Indian Ocean Rim cultures including India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Yemen, The Republic of Tanzania, Mauritius, Madagascar, the Cocos and Christmas Islands. These images leave the viewer, as Tim Winton said in Pam’s award-winning book Going East, “...grateful for having been taken so mysteriously by surprise and so far and sweetly abroad.”  His book Going East was featured in Phaidon’s History of the Photobook Vol 2 in 2006. His prints are in national and private collections in Australia, France, Great Britain Italy and Japan. Some of the published books on Max Pam’s work include: Max Pam (1999), Ethiopia (1999), and Indian Ocean Journals (2000).

It was while Badra worked as a first aid responder that he started to take his first pictures as an amateur photographer. It wasn’t until the chemical attack on Ghouta in 2013, when he witnessed a horrific atrocity, that he realized the power that photographs have to capture humanity and history.

That year, he started sending pictures for Reuters as a freelance photographer, and in 2015 Badra started working with EPA as a staff photographer based in Douma.

In 2016, he was awarded Young Photographer of the Year in the Prix Bayeux-Calvados War Correspondents Competition. The same year, he was named Time Magazine’s Wire Photographer of the Year for 2016, and won 3rd prize in UNICEF’s Photo of the Year.

In 2018, he received the Marco Luchetta Award for Photography, 1st place in News/Events of IPPAWARDS, and second place in News pictures story of Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar. In April 2018, Badra was forcibly displaced from his home in Douma to Idlib, and eventually left Syria for Turkey.

Omar Victor Diop was born in Dakar in 1980. From his early days, he developed an interest for photography and design, essentially as a means to capture the diversity of modern African societies and lifestyles.

The quick success of his first conceptual project Fashion 2112: Le Futur du Beau, which was featured at the Pan African Exhibition of the African Biennale of Photography of 2011 in Bamako (Rencontres de Bamako), encouraged him to end his career in corporate communications to dedicate to photography in 2012.

Omar Victor Diop’s body of work includes fine arts and fashion photography as well as advertising photography. He enjoys mixing his photography with other forms of art, such as costume design, styling and creative writing. This is particularly visible in the series Studio des Vanités (2013), in which he follows his research between photography and design, with a strong influence from African portraitists. His project Diaspora (2014) is a time travel, a journey that takes its starting point in the present, focusing on the issue of immigration of African people in Europe and their place in European society. His latest series Liberty (2017) recalls, interprets and juxtaposes moments of Black protests differentiated by time, geography or size, placing them in the same chronology, that of a frantic quest for freedom.

1761,Paolo Verzone,Italy,"For almost 30 years, Paolo Verzone has been photographing the world around him. At his beginnings, he covers the news as it appears in the pages of European and international magazines: a world in perpetual motion, ever so changing, which he observes with the distance of those not bound to the emergency of the moment. With rigor and eclecticism, he goes from news assignments to long term projects, from embedded documentary stories to posed portraits. From black and white to color, as well, and finally from analog to digital. Over time, his interest of the world is drawn more and more towards its people. He develops demanding sets of photographs made with a medium format view camera, that imposes a focus on the subject, presented full-length. Whether it is a set of portraits of Europeans at the beach, Seeuropeans (1994 / 2002), or the Moscow Project (1991 / 2011), produced in collaboration with Alessandro Albert, the sum of the people photographed reflect upon the multiplicity and singularity of each individual. With his project on the cadets of the main European military academies, started in 2009, Paolo Verzone maps us contemporary Europe through a part of its youth, while questioning the European identity.  Paolo Verzone was awarded at World Press Photo in 2000, 2009, and 2015. His photographs are part of different collections at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and the Instituto Nazionale della Grafica, in Rome.","{'Alessandro Albert', 'Paolo Verzone'}",2,"{'the Instituto Nazionale', 'the Bibliothèque Nationale de France', 'World Press Photo', 'the Victoria & Albert Museum'}",4,"{'Moscow', 'Rome'}",2

He focuses on long-term projects that blend photography with investigative journalism. In 2003, with the award-winning writer Serge Michel, he published the book Un monde de Brut (A Crude World). Tackling the subject of the oil industry, this story involved working in twelve countries, including Angola, Russia, Kazakhstan, Texas and Iraq. In 2004, Woods published the book American Chaos, a detailed reportage on western involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. Both books have been published in France and Italy, and as magazine pieces in over ten different countries. In 2007 and 2008, Woods documented the rise of Chinese influence in Africa. The book Chinafrica, again co-authored with Serge Michel, was published in France and translated into eleven languages. The work has been acclaimed as the most thorough investigation of the phenomenon, and as an exemplary encounter between fine art and documentary photography. In 2010, Woods completed the project Walk on my Eyes, an intimate portrait of the Iranian society. The resulting book was published in France and has been translated into German, Spanish and Persian. The associated exhibition premiered at the Festival of Arles in France, and is currently touring worldwide.

	Woods’ work is regularly featured in international publications, and he has had solo exhibitions in, amongst others, France, the US, Italy, China, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as numerous group shows around the world.

Despite the personal peril he often faces while working in some of the planet’s most remote and harsh environments, Nicklen travels constantly in search of meaningful stories that can help touch people’s emotions and help the public connect with Earth’s marine and polar realms.  Nicklen has received more than 20 international awards, six of which were from World Press Photo, including the first prize for nature stories in 2010; three with Pictures of the Year International; and ten with BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year including the grand prize awarded to him in 2012. In 2012, the National Resources Defense Council awarded him the first Biogems Visionary Award, and he also received the Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award from his alma mater, the University of Victoria.","{'Paul Nicklen', 'Nicklen'}",2,"{'the National Resources Defense Council', 'National Geographic', 'the University of Victoria', 'BBC Wildlife Photographer', 'World Press Photo'}",5,{'Baffin Island'},1

1859, Platon,United Kingdom,"Platon was born in London in 1968, but raised in the Greek Isles, until his family returned to England in the 1970s. He is currently based in New York. He attended St. Martin’ s School of Art in London, and after receiving his BA with honors in graphic design, went on to an MA in photography and fine art at the Royal College of Art. After working for British Vogue for several years, he was invited to New York to work for the late John Kennedy Jr., at his political magazine, George.

	After shooting portraits for a range of international publications, including Rolling Stone, the New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, Esquire, GQ, and The Sunday Times Magazine, Platon developed a special relationship with Time magazine, producing over 20 covers. In 2007, Platon photographed Russian premier Vladimir Putin for Time’s Person of the Year cover. This image won a World Press Photo first prize.

	In 2008, Platon signed a multiyear contract with The New Yorker. As staff photographer, he has produced a series of large-scale photo essays, two of which won ASME awards, in 2009 and 2010. Platon’s New Yorker portfolios have focused on many themes, including President Obama’s inauguration, the US military, portraits of world leaders, and the civil rights movement. In 2009, Platon teamed up with the Human Rights Watch in projects that have highlighted human-rights defenders from Burma, Russia, and Egypt. Following his coverage of Burma, Platon photographed Aung San Suu Kyi for the cover of Time, days after her release from house arrest. Subsequently, Platon won a Peabody Award for his coverage of Russian civil society. In 2012, he became Newsweek’s only contract photographer, and also joined the Council for Global Agenda at the World Economic Forum.

	Platon’s first monograph Platon’s Republic, published in 2004, includes a broad range of celebrities, politicians, athletes and cultural events. To coincide with its publication, the work was exhibited internationally, in London at the Saatchi Gallery as well as at the Milk Gallery in New York. His second book, Power—a collection of portraits of over 100 world leaders—was also released as an app, winning a Gold Cube Award at the Art Director’s Club in New York City. The book showcases portraits of world leaders from Barack Obama to Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, and Robert Mugabe to Silvio Berlusconi. The project has been exhibited at the WestLicht Museum of Photography in Vienna, and at the Florida Museum for Photographic Art in Tampa.

This six-year journey became her first monograph Pipe Dreams: A Chronicle of Lives Along the Pipeline, published in 2009. The project received numerous awards, including a Getty Images Editorial grant. 

In 2012, Effendi published her second monograph Liquid Land, where her images of Baku are paired with photographs of perished butterflies hunted by her father, a Soviet entomologist, who collected more than 30,000 butterflies in the Soviet Union. Liquid Land punctuates the theme of fragility and environmental decay of her native city.  

Over the past two decades, Effendi has photographed human interest stories around the world, working frequently as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine. In 2011, she received the Prince Claus Fund Award for Cultural Development. In the words of the awards committee, two qualities pervade Effendi’s photography: a deep sense of empathy and a quiet celebration of the strength of the human spirit. Effendi was twice short-listed for the Prix-Pictet Global Award for Photography and Sustainability. In 2020, Effendi’s work for the Wall Street Journal received two awards from the Overseas Press Club of America. Rena Effendi is a member of the Cultural Leadership network of the World Economic Forum.

1911,Riccardo Venturi,Italy,"Riccardo Venturi was born in Rome in 1966. His interest in photography began during his last years of high school and led to studies at the Istituto Superiore di Fotografia in Rome. His career as a photojournalist began in the late 1980s, covering mainly national and European news and events, and such themes as immigration and student activism. A personal research project on the city of Naples, and an investigation-dossier into the scandal surrounding the Irpinia Earthquake Fund, led to a series of publications in leading Italian magazines and newspapers. Over the 1990s he broadened his field of interest to a more international focus. Projects included a reportage on conditions in Albania after the communist era, an investigation of child prostitution in Thailand, and of Nazi skinheads in Germany. In the mid 1990s his attention was mainly drawn towards countries in conflict. Work on Afghanistan won a World Press Photo prize in 1997, and in 1999 Venturi was awarded a Leica Honorable Mention for reporting the war in Kosovo. His coverage of conflict zones has also taken him to Sierra Leone, Burundi, Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda. He has also covered significant international events, such as the tsunami in Sri Lanka and in Indonesia, and the earthquake that struck Iran in 2004. Currently, Venturi alternates between international news and personal projects. He often works in collaboration with humanitarian agencies, such as the World Health Organization, with whom he has been working over the past two years on a project about tuberculosis worldwide. A project on work-related deaths and disability-causing accidents became a book, as did one focusing on Middle-Eastern identity. Venturi joined Contrasto in 2001. In 2007 he was given the UCSI award, and in 2008 won the Marco Luchetta award.",{'Riccardo Venturi'},1,"{'the World Health Organization', 'the Istituto Superiore di Fotografia', 'Venturi', 'the Irpinia Earthquake Fund', 'UCSI', 'Contrasto'}",6,"{'Sri Lanka', 'Kosovo', 'Sierra Leone', 'Germany', 'Rome', 'Albania', 'Naples', 'Burundi', 'Afghanistan', 'Somalia', 'Liberia', 'Indonesia', 'Iran', 'Rwanda', 'Thailand'}",15

A storyteller, Sarah Waiswa’s work focuses on identity – particularly the New African Identity – and explores themes around isolation and belonging.

Her work has been exhibited around the world, most recently at the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and as part of the group show ""African Mētrópolis. An Imaginary city"" at the National Museum of the 21st Century Arts in Rome.

2089,Simona Ghizzoni,Italy,"Simona Ghizzoni is a photographer, visual artist and activist for women's rights. 

In her practice, Ghizzoni blurs the lines between documentary and personal research. While her images are often socially inspired, she tends to employ a personal and participative narrative that arises from the intimate relationships she creates with others. This can be seen in her autobiographical work on eating disorders, Odd Days, and her self-portraits series, Aftermath/Rayuela, which addresses the relationship between humankind and nature.

Her work has received several prizes, including in the 2008 and 2012 World Press Photo Contests, Poyi, The Aftermath Project, Burn Magazine Emerging Photographer Grant, BBC Arabic Film and Documentary Festival, Margaret Mead Film Festival, Sony World Photography Award, National Geographic Grant, among others. Ghizzoni’s work has been widely presented in personal and collective exhibitions in various locations including the Nobel Peace Centre in Oslo, Paris Photo, PHotoESPAÑA, Auditorium Roma, Athens Photo Festival and featured in several magazines, including The Smithsonian Magazine, L’Espresso, Mail & Guardian, and El Pais. 

Ghizzoni is a TEDX speaker and regularly gives lectures in various Italian and European schools and universities. She is co-founder of MAPS Images. She is represented by MLB Gallery, Ferrara, Italy.

2090,Sin Luz: Life Without Power team,none,"As the longest power outage in U.S. history stretched on for months, the three pitched returning to the island a few months later to report on life without electricity. To create a story that had visual impact and emotional power, senior producer for video Reem Akkad, graphics director Kat Downs and senior editor at-large Ann Gerhart pulled together a team of 18 from across the newsroom to build an immersive multimedia experience. That early collaboration allowed writers, videographers, designers and developers to work fluidly together on the storytelling. Murphy worked in Puerto Rico’s mountainous region of Utuado to report on and film a teacher, nurse, and family living without electricity or running water. Leaming went to the coastal town of Yabucoa and brought back the stories of a small business owner and struggling student. Hernandez, who has relatives in Puerto Rico, dug into local reports of desperation to find characters and played the vital role of putting each individual story into the larger context.  © Edwin Avila The Washington Post’s Jorge Ribas and Seth Blanchard filmed dramatic drone footage of landscapes and mudslides. They then worked with Kolin Pope to render 3D models with photogrammetry, an innovative technology that offers audiences a new perspective on the devastation. Designer and developer Emily Yount lead the interactive’s design and Armand Emamdjomeh and Lauren Tierney built beautiful maps and graphics to provide crucial context to the story. Joanne Lee and Victoria Fogg designed icons, and Paula Duran Rehbien was critical in producing quickly a Spanish-language version of the project.

2190,Terrell Groggins,United States,"Terrell Groggins is known domestically and internationally for his compelling coverage of boxing and social injustice in Detroit, MI, United States. His observant understanding of the human condition informs his vision of the African diaspora. Beyond photography, he dedicates significant time to developing his filmmaking career as a director.

Since 2008, Groggins has worked as a financial advisor for educators in Michigan and is a pillar in the community mentoring youth. His compassion and commitment to young people are deeply rooted in growing up in a single-parent home but living on a block where everyone looked out for each other. His mother and grandmother, Edna, raised him to the best of their abilities, but when family was not present, it was the local neighborhood of grounded men that filled in to make sure he wouldn’t fail in life.

Groggins' journey to becoming a photographer began with his neighbor’s mother, a Japanese foreign language teacher, who showed him a worldlier perspective outside of Detroit.

In 2012, desperate to find value in life after years of grieving his younger brother’s death in 2008, he picked up a camera and found joy, passion, and the fulfillment he had been searching for his whole life through photography. Groggins learned he could be involved in the things that were important to him (education, empowerment, activism, inspiring and motivating others, history, and also creating art, fashion, travel, meeting new people, and working for himself).

A self-taught photographer with no former training, he has catapulted from an unfamiliar name to being sought after for his signature photographic style. In 2012, he founded the photography company and brand My Art My Rules.

Samuel Granados, senior graphics editor, led the team’s effort to create a digital narrative that would immerse the viewer in the journey and peril experienced by those refugees and migrants. Zoeann Murphy, a video journalist who had spent more than a decade documenting refugee issues, led the video storytelling effort. And London bureau chief, Griff Witte, who had previously reported on the unfolding events on Lesbos, led the print narrative focusing on the island and its dynamics.

	Together they gathered a wide range of conventional and non-conventional visuals and testimonials from families, aid organizations, and locals on the island. In addition to filming, photographing, writing, and recording natural sounds, they gathered materials made by the refugees and migrants themselves including photographs, illustrations and cell phone footage.

	Back in Washington DC, the team worked together to shape the story and design the interactive. Kevin Schaul, an award-winning visual journalist well versed in digital design, built the backend of the pioneering new storytelling platform, where the user can choose the depth of his own experience in the story. Kat Downs, Washington Post’s graphics director, and Emily Chow, assignment editor, edited the piece. The resulting project, The Waypoint, became a template for future major enterprise collaborations between departments at The Washington Post and helped pave the way for more innovation and engaging storytelling.","{'Zoeann Murphy', 'Samuel Granados', 'Emily Chow', 'Kevin Schaul', 'Kat Downs'}",5,"{'Lesbos', 'Washington Post’s', 'The Washington Post', 'Griff Witte'}",4,"{'Washington DC', 'London'}",2

2256,Ton Koene,the Netherlands,"Ton Koene (48) holds a degree in humanitarian practice from Oxford University. After graduating in 1989, he worked for sixteen years for Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF), primarily as Head of Mission in twelve conflict areas, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia, Chechnya, Angola and Sudan. He was responsible for all humanitarian operations in these countries.Koene found himself increasingly drawn to photography and missed creativity in the humanitarian world. In 2006, he resigned from MSF and began working as a freelance photojournalist. He continued traveling to (post-) conflict countries, exchanging the syringe for a camera. His photo documentaries have covered such topics as prostitution in Nigeria, coal mining in Bulgaria, malnutrition in Somalia, genocide in Darfur, and the Inuits of the North Pole. Humanitarianism has always been the main focus of his features.Koene’s photos have been published in many international magazines and newspapers, and his photo archives are represented by agencies over the world. Since starting as a professional photographer, Koene has produced five photo books and one textbook (about how to survive in dangerous countries).Koene is an autodidact photographer. In his opinion, a keen eye, a passion for photography and knowing how to deal with people are the most important ingredients for success—technique is overrated. Since January 2010, Koen has been  based in Afghanistan as a freelance photographer for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant.","{'Koen', 'Ton Koene', 'de Volkskrant', 'Koene'}",4,"{'Oxford University', 'Koene'}",2,"{'Sudan', 'Bosnia', 'Chechnya', 'Bulgaria', 'Somalia', 'Nigeria', 'Angola', 'Afghanistan', 'Darfur'}",9

2313,Vincent Laforet,France/USA,"Vincent Laforet, a three-time winner at the prestigious 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, is a director and Pulitzer Prize–winning photographer who is known for his forward-thinking approach to image-making and storytelling. In addition to having been commissioned by just about every important international publication—including Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, National Geographic, Sports Illustrated, Time, Newsweek and Life — Laforet is considered a pioneer both for his innovative tilt-shift and aerial photography and in the field of HD-capable DSLR cameras. In fact, his short film Reverie, the first 1080p video shot with a still camera, was seen by more than 2 million times on the first week of its release in 2009. Laforet, who was born in 1975, began his photography career at the age of 15. He started as a photojournalist, honing his abilities by landing internships with newspapers such as The Los Angeles Times and with Reuters. By the time he was 25, he had established himself as the youngest staff photographer for The New York Times and, by the time he left, he had a Pulitzer for feature photography under his belt. “His images stir with life,” PDN wrote of him in a 2003 “One to Watch” profile. “Athletes are colorful heroes ripped from comic book pages while his wartime photographs successfully wander between the unimaginably large scale and the touchingly human.” In 2005, American Photo named him one of the '100 Most Influential People in Photography,' and his work has been recognized in the Communication Arts and PDN annuals and by the World Press Photo Awards, the Pictures of the Year Competition, the Overseas Press Club, the National Headliners Awards and the Pro-Football Hall of Fame, among others. In June 2010, he was honored with a Gold, Silver, and a Bronze in the Titanium category at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival for his work as the director on the groundbreaking Canon 'Beyond the Still' competition, which he spearheaded with Grey Advertising. “It’s not just the laundry list of awards that sets Laforet apart, though,” noted The FStop magazine in a 2010 interview with Laforet, whose fine-art prints have been exhibited worldwide and are part of numerous private collections. “It’s his steady and unique growth as a photographer. From shooting weddings [as a teen] to the NBA finals in college to his job at the Times and now his much publicized move to commercial photography and motion work, it’s been a long and fruitful evolution.” Since 2006, Laforet himself has charted this evolution on his blog, which has become a must read in the photographic and filmmaking communities, attracting more than 3,000,000 visitors each year. His combination of candor and expertise have made him highly sought after as a consultant (for companies such as Apple, Canon, Manfrotto, Lexar, X-Rite, and Zeiss), a keynote speaker and an instructor. Laforet, who has been profiled on CNN, Good Morning America and in dozens of publications, has served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and at the International Center of Photography. He is represented by the New York–based agency Stockland Martel and resides in Manhattan Beach, California, with his wife, Amber, son Noah and daughter Eliana.
