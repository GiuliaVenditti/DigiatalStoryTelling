        <h1>Does streaming service have an impact on diversity?</h1>
        <p>The number of female directors has grown over the years and reached peaks in 2017 and 2020, but probably follows the general trend of film additions that increases over the years and decreases in 2020, most likely due to the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the entertainment industry world.
          This means that as women increase, so do men, and the ratio of male to female executives remains essentially unchanged over time.</p>

        <p>The increase of Netflix's notoriety and success began in 2013, as we can see from the graph, the following years from 2015 to 2020 have a sharp increase in series and especially in movie additions.
          In 2020 the trend reverses and there is a decline in integrations, this is probably caused by the impact that the covid-19 pandemic has had on film productions, but also by the competition made to Netflix by many other companies that imitate Netflix and reproduce the model.
          In some cases this meant some major sacrifices for Netflix, for example when Disney + made its debut, it meant the end of Disney blockbusters, like the Star Wars movies, available on Netflix or other platforms.

       <h1>...All year round</h1> 
        <p>A curious thing to notice is the trend of additions over the year and the increase or decrease in additions over the months. For example Netflix has its peak of additions during the months of March, July, September and above all December.
          It seems to path the Western work / school and holiday cycle model; spring break, summer break, school start in September and Christmas break.</p>

        The gap for TV shows seems more regular than for movies. This is likely due to subsequent series being released year by year. Spain seems to have the newest content overall on Netflix while Indian TV shows are the newest on Amazon.

      <h1>Who are the distributors?</h1> 
      <p>Our dataset represents data from films hosted on Prime Video and Netflix platforms, the data on distributors refers to the company that initially distributed the title. On streaming platforms, most movies are distributed by the platform itself or by other streaming services such as Hulu. Dominant in the chart is Netflix followed by Amazon. Among the traditional theatrical distributor, only Warner Bros seems to be competitive.</p>

        <p>Netflix and Amazon are not strong distributors of major award-winning films, but both are receiving many lesser-known awards. Until 2020 the rules of the Academy Awards stipulated that a film must have a theatrical release in order to win an Oscar and many films released on streaming platforms were considered "TV Movies". So the question of whether or not streaming services can qualify for certain awards is still being debated by the film community.</p>

      <h1>What does the audience think?</h1> 
      <p> 

        Streaming services connect the way people watch movies. We compare general public opinion (expressed in iMDb reatings) with the critics ones (Rotten Tomatoes). If we look at how these indices evolve over the years, we can see that up until the 1990s both indices followed a similar pattern of peaks and troughs, with critics overall more enthusiastic about films than audiences. Between the 1990s and 2010s, audiences and critics diverged, with audiences more generous with films. Finally, in the last decade, trends have changed again, but both critics and public opinion have increasingly appreciated the films.

        <p class="large first_l">There are several factors that can explain this phenomenon, (for instance both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes are very recent, so the opinion on old movies is mostly retroactive). Anyway, it is clear that critics’ opinions and public opinions of movies are undergoing a transformation over the last 20 years and it is likely that this also depends on the new ways of movie consumption, introduced by streaming services over the last years.</p>

        <p class="large"><strong>YES</strong> </p>  
        <p>
          Streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have created new ways of watching movies and TV series: they have impacted where the contents we watch come from, filling their catalogues with many movies from around the world, and they have had a major impact on the distribution of films becoming a fundamental outlet for cinematic content, they have influenced the awarding of films and are changing the opinion of critics and audiences.

        <p class="large"><strong>  NO</strong></p>
        <p>Despite everything, 50% of the films we watch come from the United States and 80% are produced by men. The market, therefore, appears to be Anglo-centric and still not open to diversity.
