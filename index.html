        <p>We used Gender-guesser phyton’s library to determine the gender of the directors by their names, this library can fail sometimes as it is mostly trained on Anglo-Saxon names, thus we must take into account a margin of error. Nonetheless, more than 80% of all directors resulted to be men.
          Of the rest approximately 4% remain unknown, 12% are women and only 2 authors are recorded as transgender females and 2 as nonbinary.</p>

        <p>The number of female directors grows over the years and reaches its peaks in 2017 and 2020, but it probably follows the general trend of movie additions that grows over the years and decreases in 2020, likely for the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic had on the entertainment industry.
          This means that while women increase so do men and the proportion between men and women directors remains mostly unchanged over the years.</p>

          We can see that the bigger portion of the content is aimed at adults in both series and movies, and the quantity of content decreases with the age of the target, an exception is the age group between 13 and 16, very targeted by movies and almost completely discarded by tv series.</p>

       <h1>Netflix over the years</h1> 
        <p>Netflix’s rise in notoriety and success started in 2013 as we can see from the graph the following years from 2015 to 2020 have a steep increase in series and especially in movie additions.
          in 2020 the trend inverts and there is a decrease in additions, this is likely caused by the impact the covid-19 pandemic had on cinematographic productions, but also by the concurrence made to Netflix by many other companies imitating Netflix and reproducing its model.
          In some cases this meant for Netflix some important renounces, for example When Disney+ made its debut, it meant the end of Disney blockbusters, such as the Star Wars films, being available on Netflix or other platforms.

       <h1>...All year round</h1> 
        <p>One curious thing to watch is the trend of additions over the year and the increase or decrease of additions over the months, for example, Netflix has its peak of additions during the months of March, July, September, and especially December.
          It seems to recalculate the pattern of the western work/school and holiday cycle, spring break, summer vacation, the start of school in September, and the Christmas holidays.</p>

        <p>One curious thing to notice is that Amazon Prime Video in this instance seems to be mirroring each other, so even if we can see a similar pattern in Amazon, (with peaks at the start of spring, summer, and fall). We notice that the peaks of content addition often don’t meet for both distributors. _The most noticeable are in December and July when addition for amazon drop, or in June when Amazon’s additions steeply increase.</p>

      <h1>Vintage Hong Kong Movies</h1> 
      <p>Another way to look at cultural representation on streaming platforms is by taking notice if their cinema history is represented. The average gap between when content is released, and when it is then added varies by country. In Spain and Nigeria, Netflix appears to be dominated by newer movies whereas Hong Kong & India have an older average movie. Amazon on the contrary has newer Chinese movies and older French movies.</p>

      <p>The span between the year of addition and movie release year is very close. The gap for TV shows seems more regular than for movies.

      <h1>Who are the distributors</h1> 
      <p>Our dataset represents data from films hosted on Prime Video and Netflix platforms, the data on distributors refers to the company that initially distributed the movie, so we expect to find all the movies distributed by Netflix and prime video along with data on the movie that were distributed by other companies and later added to Netflix and Amazon.
        Therefore it is expected to see Prime Video and Netflix as major distributors in this dataset. However, Netflix appears to be the most prominent distributor, and this shows that it really became an important presence in the entertainment industry.</p>

        <p>Netflix and Amazon aren’t strong distributors of movies prized by important awards,
          But they are both receiving many prizes in the category of awards that represent smaller and fewer know prizes on our dataset.
          Until 2020 the Academy awards rules stipulated that a movie needed to have a theatrical release to be able to win an oscar and many Movie released on Streaming platforms are considered “Tv movies”, so the question is where or not they are eligible for certain prizes is still discussed by the cinema community</p>

      <h1>Critics vs the Public</h1> 
      <p>To understand what the critique and the public think of the movies we use two measures:
        Rotten Tomatoes (critics’ reviews aggregator) scores  and  IMDb Scores  that can be considered a good measure of public opinion.
       If we watch how these indexes evolve over the years we can notice that until the 90’s both indexes followed a similar pattern of peaks and depressions, with the critique being overall more enthusiastic about movies than the public. Between the ’90s and 2010’s the public and the critics diverged, with the public being more generous with movies. Finally, in the last decade, the trends changed again but with both critics and public opinion growing more appreciative of movies.</p>
