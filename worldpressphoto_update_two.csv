                                Conflict between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern Caucasus resumed in September, after a lull of 30 years. In the 1980s, as the Soviet Union was crumbling, the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh, part of Azerbaijan, called for independence. Secessionist Armenians and Azerbaijani troops entered into a conflict that intensified during the 1990s, and continued until a ceasefire in 1994. More than 20,000 people died and a million people, both Armenian and Azerbaijani, were displaced. Victorious ethnic Armenians proclaimed a de facto independent state, naming it Artsakh. Over the next 30 years, the two sides maintained a tense coexistence, with periodic military clashes. A July 2020 border clash triggered massive protests in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, with thousands of demonstrators calling for the country to retake Nagorno-Karabakh. Hostilities, which each side blames the other for starting, were renewed on 27 September in what became known as the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Conflict continued until 9 November, the worst fighting the area had seen since the 1990s. In a settlement brokered by Russia in November, the parties agreed to cease hostilities. Azerbaijan regained possession of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent territories of Lachin, Kelbajar and Agdam, but the regional capital, Stepanakert, along with some other territories, remained under ethnic Armenian control. A corridor, patrolled by Russian peacekeepers, will connect Armenia to Stepanakert. Although fighting is over, reconciliation will prove difficult both to Armenians who feel they have lost their homeland and are now displaced, and to Azerbaijanis returning to a region ravaged by war.","Shutter Speed

                                The Flint Jaguars basketball team in Flint, Michigan, USA, embodies efforts to nurture stability, encourage mutual support and strengthen community spirit in a city struggling to survive. Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, is striving against outmigration caused by a precipitous decline in its motor industry, a health crisis brought about by the authorities switching water-supply sources without proper safeguards, and the systemic neglect of high-poverty, predominantly Black neighborhoods. Basketball is an integral part of Flint culture, and the city once produced dozens of big names at collegiate and professional levels. For decades, four high school teams battled as fierce rivals. Now there is only one high school in town. The Flint Jaguars were established in 2017, merging the teams of the last two schools that remained at the time. In 2020, the team fought to turn around what had up until then been a nearly winless history. By March, they were prepared to head to the division finals with an 18-4 record, having won more games in 2020 than in the previous three years combined. Their play-off run ended prematurely when COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the season. Nevertheless, the student athletes had had a taste of collective success.","Shutter Speed

Al-Barghouthi’s wife, Iman Nafi, keeps all her husband’s clothes and belongings in place. Al-Barghouthi was arrested in 1978 after an anti-Israel commando operation.

                                Nearly 4,200 Palestinian security detainees are being held in Israeli prisons, according to a February 2021 report by human rights organization B’Tselem. Some face sentences of 20 years or more. To visit a Palestinian prisoner in an Israeli jail, visitors have to overcome a number of different limitations resulting from border laws, prison regulations, and restrictions set by the Israel Security Agency (ISA). Visitors are usually allowed to see prisoners only through a transparent partition, and talk to them via a telephone receiver. Conjugal visits are denied and physical contact is forbidden, except for children under the age of ten, who are allowed ten minutes at the end of each visit to embrace their fathers. Since the early 2000s, long-term Palestinian detainees hoping to raise families have been smuggling semen out of prison, hidden in gifts to their children. Semen is smuggled in a variety of ways, such as in pen tubes, plastic candy wrappers, and inside bars of chocolate. In February 2021, Middle East Monitor reported that the 96th Palestinian baby had been born using sperm smuggled from Israeli prison.

                                This was the first hug Rosa had received in five months. In March, care homes across the country had closed their doors to all visitors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing millions of Brazilians from visiting their elderly relatives. Carers were ordered to keep physical contact with the vulnerable to an absolute minimum. At Viva Bem, a simple invention, ‘The Hug Curtain', allowed people to hug each other once again. The new coronavirus had first appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and by January 2020 had begun to spread around the world. On 11 March, the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The disease—transmitted mainly via close contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols—could be fatal, and people over the age of 70 were one of the groups considered most vulnerable to the disease. Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed claims about the severity of the pandemic and the danger posed by the virus, undermined quarantine measures adopted at state level, and encouraged Brazilians to continue working to keep the economy afloat. Brazil ended 2020 with one of the worst records globally in dealing with the virus, with some 7.7 million reported cases and 195,000 deaths.","Shutter Speed

                                Ignat was bullied throughout his school years, and confronted by the school psychologist following rumors that he spoke about himself using the masculine gender. Ignat opened up to the psychologist about his gender identity—the first stranger to whom he had told everything—but asked to keep it a secret. The whole school found out, and the insults and humiliations became permanent. Many LGBTQ+ people in Russia keep low profiles because of stigmatization against non-traditional sexuality. An amendment to the Russian constitution, made in July 2020, stipulates that marriage is a union between a man and a woman, with no other options possible. Although an attempt was made to make a further amendment preventing transgender people from changing their status on legal documents, it was not passed. Transgender people can marry, but the road there is difficult. Transgender people also face very specific challenges when accessing their economic, social, and cultural rights, as their gender is not legally recognized. This results in transgender people having no access to transition-related healthcare services, or official support against discrimination.","Shutter Speed

                                The Emancipation Memorial shows Lincoln holding the Emancipation Proclamation in one hand, with his other hand over the head of a Black man in a loincloth, kneeling at his feet. Critics argue that the statue is paternalistic, demeaning in its depiction of Black Americans, and that it doesn’t do justice to the role that Black people played in their own liberation. Those against removal say it is a positive depiction of people being freed from the shackles of slavery, and that removing such monuments can amount to an erasing of history. The drive to remove the statue came amid a wave of calls to take down monuments of Confederate generals nationwide, a move largely welcomed by activists from the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, who see Confederate and other such monuments as reminders of an oppressive history. They call for a more honest accounting of American history. Officials had erected barriers around the Emancipation Memorial in advance of demonstrations. Residents posted notes on the fence expressing their views, and on 25 June around 100 people gathered at the monument arguing about what it meant. In February 2021, congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton reintroduced a bill in the US Congress to have the statue removed and taken to a museum.","Shutter Speed

Fighting Locust Invasion in East Africa,Luis Tato,"24 April, 2020",For The Washington Post,"2021 Photo Contest, World Press Photo of the Year Nominee","24 April, 2020
                                                    
                                Henry Lenayasa, chief of the settlement of Archers Post, in Samburu County, Kenya, tries to scare away a massive swarm of locusts ravaging grazing area, on 24 April. Locust swarms devastated large areas of land, just as the coronavirus outbreak had begun to disrupt livelihoods.
                            
                                                    
                                In early 2020, Kenya experienced its worst infestation of desert locusts in 70 years. Swarms of locusts from the Arabian Peninsula had migrated into Ethiopia and Somalia in the summer of 2019. Continued successful breeding, together with heavy autumn rains and a rare late-season cyclone in December 2019, triggered another reproductive spasm. The locusts multiplied and invaded new areas in search of food, arriving in Kenya and spreading through other countries in eastern Africa. Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, are potentially the most destructive of the locust pests, as swarms can fly rapidly across great distances, traveling up to 150 kilometers a day. A single swarm can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer. Each locust can eat its weight in plants each day: a swarm the size of Paris could eat the same amount of food in one day as half the population of France. Locusts produce two to five generations a year, depending on environmental conditions. In dry spells, they crowd together on remaining patches of land. Prolonged wet weather—producing moist soil for egg-laying, and abundant food— encourages breeding and producing large swarms that travel in search of food, devastating farmland. Even before this outbreak, nearly 20 million people faced high levels of food insecurity across the East African region, challenged by periodic droughts and floods. COVID-19 restrictions in the region slowed efforts to fight the infestation as supply chains of pesticides were disrupted.","Shutter Speed

                                An injured man stands near the site of a massive explosion in the port of Beirut, Lebanon, while firefighters work to put out the fires that engulfed the warehouses after the explosion.
                            
                                                    
                                At around 6pm on 4 August, a massive explosion, caused by more than 2,750 tons of high density ammonium nitrate, shook Lebanon’s capital Beirut. The explosive compound was being stored in a warehouse in the port. Some 100,000 people lived within a kilometer of the warehouse. The explosion, which measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, damaged or destroyed around 6,000 buildings, killed at least 190 people, injured a further 6,000, and displaced as many as 300,000. The ammonium nitrate came from a ship that had been impounded in 2012 for failing to pay docking fees and other charges, and apparently abandoned by its owner. Customs officials wrote to the Lebanese courts at least six times between 2014 and 2017, asking how to dispose of the explosive. In the meantime, it was stored in the warehouse in an inappropriate climate. It is not clear what detonated the explosion, but contamination by other substances, either while in transport or in storage, appear the most likely cause. Many citizens saw the incident as symptomatic of the ongoing problems the country is facing, namely governmental failure, mishandling and corruption. In the days after the blast, tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of central Beirut, some clashing with security forces and taking over government buildings, in protest against a political system they saw as unwilling to fix the country’s problems.","Shutter Speed

                                This was the first hug Rosa had received in five months. In March, care homes across the country had closed their doors to all visitors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing millions of Brazilians from visiting their elderly relatives. Carers were ordered to keep physical contact with the vulnerable to an absolute minimum. At Viva Bem, a simple invention, ‘The Hug Curtain', allowed people to hug each other once again. The new coronavirus had first appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and by January 2020 had begun to spread around the world. On 11 March, the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The disease—transmitted mainly via close contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols—could be fatal, and people over the age of 70 were one of the groups considered most vulnerable to the disease. Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed claims about the severity of the pandemic and the danger posed by the virus, undermined quarantine measures adopted at state level, and encouraged Brazilians to continue working to keep the economy afloat. Brazil ended 2020 with one of the worst records globally in dealing with the virus, with some 7.7 million reported cases and 195,000 deaths.","Shutter Speed

                                On 25 May, George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Four days later, Derek Chauvin, the police officer who had been filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes, was charged with murder. A bystander video of the encounter went viral, setting off protests first in Minneapolis and then around the rest of the country. Thousands of people gathered at a makeshift memorial the day after Floyd’s death, where organizers of the rally emphasized keeping the protest peaceful. Although daytime rallies throughout the metropolitan area were mostly peaceful events, nighttime demonstrations escalated into more extreme action, including looting and arson, in which people who were not part of the protest became involved. On 28 May the National Guard was activated. To many, the violence was an understandable response to years of injustice at the hands of the police. In the months that followed, large protests were held in more than 150 American cities, a nationwide call for racial justice not seen since the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Polls taken in June by four different agencies indicate that between 15 million and 26 million people across the US participated in the protests, making it the largest movement in US history. Protests in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement spread to more than 2,000 cities in some 60 countries worldwide.","Shutter Speed

                                Peru saw its greatest political instability in 20 years in mid-November, with three presidents coming into power over the course of little more than a week, resulting in massive protests throughout the country. On 9 November, the Peruvian national congress impeached President Martin Vizcarra, condemning his handling of the COVID-19 crisis and alleging that he had taken bribes while serving as a regional governor—a claim he denied. During his tenure, Vizcarra faced opposition from Congress, but amassed wide popularity, especially among Peruvian youth, as an anti-corruption crusader. Crowds began to gather at Plaza San Martín in Lima in protest at Congress’s move, spawning demonstrations in other parts of the country. Congress speaker Manuel Merino was installed as interim president on 10 November, sparking accusations of a parliamentary coup. Protests intensified, and on 12 November a National March occurred throughout Peru, demanding his resignation. On 14 November, thousands of people again took to the streets in a second National March, with many dressed in black. In Lima, two people were killed and more than 100 were injured in violent clashes with police. Manuel Merino resigned on 15 November, setting off celebrations in the streets. A new president, Francisco Sagasti, was inaugurated two days later.","Shutter Speed

                                A wildfire began in Oliveira de Frades, about 100 kilometers from Porto in eastern Portugal, on 7 September, and spread some 30 kilometers west, to Sever do Vouga, and 40 kilometers southwest, to Águeda, in the neighboring district. At least 300 firefighters, 100 land vehicles and ten firefighting planes battled the blaze in a landscape dominated by eucalyptus trees. The uncontrolled spread of eucalyptus trees—which supply raw material for an economically important pulp industry, but which are extremely flammable—are a major factor in the rapid spread of wildfires. Portugal has a wildfire season lasting from June to September. Its hot climate, consistent warm winds coming off the Atlantic, and a well-forested landscape make it particularly susceptible to fire. Extreme temperatures and severe drought contributed to the 2020 fire season. A 2020 report released jointly by the Portuguese Association of Nature and the World Wide Fund for Nature states that Portugal is the European country worst affected by wildfires: more than three percent of its forest burns every year.","Shutter Speed

Olga waited outside the prison for two hours, but Paval was not freed. Paval Sieviaryniec is a Christian Democrat politician and a well-known political activist. He is one of the founders of Youth Front, a youth movement supporting civil society based on Christian-democratic principles and the free market, and the education of young people to revive Belarusian national culture and language. He was arrested while collecting signatures in support of candidates to stand against President Alexander Lukashenko in his bid for a sixth consecutive term in office. Lukashenko had been in power since 1994. Dubbed ‘Europe’s last dictator’ by media outlets, he had frequently repressed opposition, and had not had a serious challenge to his leadership in the previous five elections. Amnesty International considers Paval Sieviaryniec a prisoner of conscience. He was still in prison in early 2021, partly in solitary confinement and unable to meet with a lawyer. He was denied access to books and television, and his Bible was taken from him.","Shutter Speed

                                The Emancipation Memorial shows President Abraham Lincoln holding the Emancipation Proclamation in one hand, with his other hand over the head of a Black man in a loincloth, kneeling at his feet. Critics argue that the statue is paternalistic, demeaning in its depiction of Black Americans, and that it doesn’t do justice to the role that Black people played in their own liberation. Those against removal say it is a positive depiction of people being freed from the shackles of slavery, and that removing such monuments can amount to an erasing of history. The drive to remove the statue came amid a wave of calls to take down monuments of Confederate generals nationwide, a move largely welcomed by activists from the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, who see Confederate and other such monuments as reminders of an oppressive history. They call for a more honest accounting of American history. Officials had erected barriers around the Emancipation Memorial in advance of demonstrations. Residents posted notes on the fence expressing their views, and on 25 June around 100 people gathered at the monument arguing about what it meant. In February 2021, congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton reintroduced a bill in the US Congress to have the statue removed and taken to a museum.","Shutter Speed

                                Saeed Ramin is a professional traceur (practitioner of parkour) living in Gachsaran, Iran. Seven years ago, Saeed fell in a parkour competition, injuring the spinal cord in his neck. The aim of parkour is to get from one point to another in complex—usually urban—environments, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible: running, vaulting, swinging, climbing and all manner of other movements, sometimes in dangerous situations such as between high rooftops. A year before he was injured, Saeed broke the Iranian record for jumping over an air bridge over asphalt. Parkour was popularized in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, video games, documentaries and advertisements, and it became popular in Iran after two Iranian traceurs appeared in the documentary, Jump London—although it is prohibited outdoors and in cities across much of the country. Saeed’s injury when he fell was so severe that he could only blink, and doctors said he wouldn’t even be able to sit in a wheelchair. Saeed couldn’t afford extended hospital treatment, but with the help of his family, he improvised rehabilitation equipment in his yard, and despite the doctors' predictions, was able to regain the mobility of his hands. Saeed has regained more of his abilities, and is now able to manage a wheelchair. He still likes to do things other people are afraid of.","Shutter Speed

                                The Borlänge Bridge Club in the municipality of Borlänge in Sweden has around 100 members. For a while, the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to games, but during the summer, a solution was found by separating players by means of crossed plexiglass screens. A tactical game of skill, contract bridge (or simply bridge) has its origins in the 16th century, in what were known as trick-taking games, but evolved into its present form in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today’s game is based on rules set out by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, an American railroad executive, in 1925. A World Bridge Federation coordinates revision of laws, and conducts world championships. Duplicate bridge, in which the same deal of cards is used at each table, is the most widely employed variation of contract bridge in club and tournament play. Bridge, as chess, is recognized as a ‘mind sport’ by the International Olympic Committee, although neither has yet been found eligible for the main Olympic program. The Swedish Bridge Federation currently has around 27,000 members and operates an annual bridge festival with more than 8,500 tables in play.","Shutter Speed

                                The Flint Jaguars basketball team in Flint, Michigan, USA, embodies efforts to nurture stability, encourage mutual support and strengthen community spirit in a city struggling to survive. Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, is striving against outmigration caused by a precipitous decline in its motor industry, a health crisis brought about by the authorities switching water-supply sources without proper safeguards, and the systemic neglect of high-poverty, predominantly Black neighborhoods. Basketball is an integral part of Flint culture, and the city once produced dozens of big names at collegiate and professional levels. For decades, four high school teams battled as fierce rivals. Now there is only one high school in town. The Flint Jaguars were established in 2017, merging the teams of the last two schools that remained at the time. In 2020, the team fought to turn around what had up until then been a nearly winless history. By March, they were prepared to head to the division finals with an 18-4 record, having won more games in 2020 than in the previous three years combined. Their play-off run ended prematurely when COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the season. Nevertheless, the student athletes had had a taste of collective success.","Shutter Speed

                                Bouldering entails climbing on small rock formations and boulders usually no more than six meters in height, without ropes or harnesses. Historically, it began as a training activity for more ambitious climbing and mountaineering pursuits, but has evolved into a sport in its own right. Rock-climbing gyms and sports facilities in Munich were closed as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, so athletes had become creative in their training methods.","Shutter Speed

                                Militaristic organizations for children, such as military schools, weekend clubs, and summer camps, are popular in Poland. Military summer camps for youth have existed in Poland since the 1920s. The young participants are put through boot camps, challenged physically and mentally, and given instruction—often on former army training grounds—in skills such as tactics, survival, self-defense, and topography. They are also taught to shoot, using air rifles and sometimes replica weaponry such as machine guns and grenade launchers. The camps are promoted as opportunities for adventure and recreation, and as character-building and encouraging team work. Organizers maintain that participating in games with replica weapons prevents children from seeking out real ones. On the other hand, there is criticism that suggests the popularity of the camps stems from the rise of nationalism in Poland, particularly since the coming into power of Law and Justice (PiS), a right-wing populist party. Patriotism and nationalism play a significant role in school education.",,"Focal length

                                Raindrops symbolize the splashing water and storms in migrants’ stories, Livorno, Italy. The photographer also sees them as a metaphor for stars flung out into space as the result of the collision of two black holes, and as representing the unknown: a place both attractive and terrifying, holding hope as well as nightmares.
                            
                                                    
                                More than one million immigrants from Africa officially reside in Italy, as well as an unknown number of undocumented migrants, many of whom have made a perilous and often life-threatening journey to get there. The photographer compares migrants in Italy to scattered stars, a constellation of young people from different countries, of different genders, and with different traits. They have all come to Italy for different personal reasons and are celebrated for their individual stories, in a way that tries to resist stereotyping of African migrants. The photographer asked them about home, dreams, and childhood memories, representing their dreams through metaphors and use of color. Most migrant crossings occur at night, which led to the metaphor of stars, rain and darkness.



A 2016 study by the International Organization of Migrants pointed to insecurity, conflict, and discrimination as the main drivers of migration, not solely economic and work reasons. Discrimination on the basis of social group, religion, or sexual orientation was mentioned by almost half of the study group. In October 2020, the Italian government adopted a decree overturning many of the anti-immigration policies introduced by the previous interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing Lega Nord (Northern League).","Shutter Speed

The survey states that the number of firearms exceeds the country’s population: 393 million guns to 328 million people. Gun ownership is guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which dates from 1791 and has long been a controversial issue in American legal, political, and social discourse. Those who argue for the repeal of the Second Amendment or introduction of stricter gun control say that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that stronger regulation will reduce gun violence; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new restrictions. Second Amendment supporters state that it protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense against threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime. The US has had more mass shootings than any other country on the planet.

                                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is known as a ‘spectrum’ disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. People on the autism spectrum may have difficulty with communication and interaction with other people, show restricted interests and repetitive behavior, and can react impulsively to environmental stimuli, which means it can be more challenging for them to function well at work, school, or in other areas of life. The concept of autism is quite new in Russia, where there is frequently a negative attitude to people who have such behavioral disorders, and people are often ashamed of being on the autism spectrum. Not many medical and non-medical professionals are familiar with autism, and it is frequently misdiagnosed. Parents of children with ASDs can experience difficulty in finding support programs.","Shutter Speed

                                Healthcare workers worldwide were at the forefront of the battle against a new coronavirus, COVID-19, which had originated in China and rapidly engulfed the world in a pandemic. Of 37 countries surveyed by Forbes in November 2020, Mexico reported 78,200 COVID infections among healthcare workers. When adjusted for population size, this was the highest rate in the world. The first COVID-19 cases in Mexico were confirmed in late February. In March, President López Obrador had played down the severity of the threat from the virus, allowing large public gatherings and preparations for the tourist season to continue. Once cases started to climb, in late March, a lockdown went into effect, but by April the president had declared the disease under control. On 13 May, less than 24 hours after the country had reported its deadliest day during the pandemic, with 353 deaths recorded, Obrador announced an easing of lockdown measures. Mexico had also come under pressure from the United States to reopen its economy to ensure continental supply chains. Exhausted healthcare workers became increasingly critical of policies that did not enforce stricter anti-COVID regulations.","Shutter Speed

                                Ignat was bullied throughout his school years, and confronted by the school psychologist following rumors that he spoke about himself using the masculine gender. Ignat opened up to the psychologist about his gender identity—the first stranger to whom he had told everything—but asked to keep it a secret. The whole school found out, and the insults and humiliations became permanent. Many LGBTQ+ people in Russia keep low profiles because of stigmatization against nontraditional sexuality. An amendment to the Russian constitution, made in July 2020, stipulates that marriage is a union between a man and a woman, with no other options possible. Although an attempt was made to make a further amendment preventing transgender people from changing their status on legal documents, it was not passed. Transgender people can marry, but the road there is difficult. Transgender people also face very specific challenges when accessing their economic, social, and cultural rights. This results in transgender people having no access to transition-related healthcare services, or offical support against discrimination.","Shutter Speed

                                In early 2020, Kenya experienced its worst infestation of desert locusts in 70 years. Swarms of locusts from the Arabian Peninsula had migrated into Ethiopia and Somalia in the summer of 2019. Continued successful breeding, together with heavy autumn rains and a rare late-season cyclone in December 2019, triggered another reproductive surge. The locusts multiplied and invaded new areas in search of food, arriving in Kenya and spreading through other countries in eastern Africa. Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) are potentially the most destructive of the locust pests, as swarms can fly rapidly across great distances, traveling up to 150 kilometers a day. A single swarm can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer. Each locust can eat its weight in plants each day: a swarm the size of Paris could eat the same amount of food in one day as half the population of France. Locusts produce two to five generations a year, depending on environmental conditions. In dry spells, they crowd together on remaining patches of land. Prolonged wet weather—producing moist soil for egg-laying, and abundant food—encourages breeding and produces large swarms that travel in search of food, devastating farmland. Border restriction necessitated by COVID-19 made controlling the locust population harder than usual, since it diverted funds, disrupted pesticide supply, and affected multiple neighboring countries already facing high levels of food insecurity.","Shutter Speed

                                Taal Volcano, in Batangas province, on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, began erupting on 12 January, spewing ash up to 14 kilometers into the air. The volcano generated ashfalls and volcanic thunderstorms, forcing evacuations from the surrounding area. The eruption progressed into a magmatic eruption, characterized by a lava fountain with thunder and lightning. According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, a total of 212,908 families, nearly 750,000 people, were affected by the eruption. Damage caused to infrastructure and livelihoods, such as farming, fishing and tourism, was put at around US$70 million. Taal volcano is in a large caldera filled by Taal Lake, and is one of the most active volcanoes in the country. It is a ‘complex volcano’, which means it doesn't have one vent or cone but several eruption points that have changed over time. Taal has had 34 recorded historical eruptions in the past 450 years, most recently in 1977. As with other volcanoes in the Philippines, Taal is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of major seismic activity that has one of the world's most active fault lines.","Shutter Speed

                                A pair of feral pigeons befriended the photographer’s family, who were isolated in their apartment in Vlaardingen, the Netherlands, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ollie and Dollie, as the family named them, were regulars in the house, their daily visits a reminder that humans are not alone on this planet, even while living isolated in urban areas. Feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica) are descended from the rock dove, which naturally inhabits sea cliffs and mountains. They find the ledges of buildings to be substitutes for sea cliffs, have adapted to urban life and surroundings, and now live in urban areas on every continent except Antarctica, with a global population in the hundreds of millions. Rock doves were the first birds to be domesticated, between five and six thousand years ago, in Mesopotamia. They were bred for food, and later trained to carry messages. Birds escaping or released from a domestic environment became the first feral (or city) pigeons. Although they are believed to be vectors of diseases, the evidence is to the contrary. It is rare for city pigeons to transmit a disease to humans, and while they do transmit contagions such as Salmonella and avian mites, infecting mammals is rare.","Shutter Speed

                                Nymphargus wileyi inhabits primary cloud forests. Individuals can be found on leaves at night. Females deposit eggs in a gelatinous mass on the dorsal surface of leaves hanging above streams, near the tip. A male can fertilize up to four clutches of eggs in a breeding season. The whitish embryos, between 19 and 28 per clutch, will develop for a few days until they are ready to drop into the water to continue their metamorphosis. Nymphargus wileyi is known only from examples discovered around the Yanayacu Biological Station, and so is listed as ‘data deficient’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN considers around 40 percent of all known amphibians to be threatened, but as not enough is known about data-deficient species, they are not included in this figure and so are often ignored in conservation strategies.","Shutter Speed

                                The Florida panther is a subspecies of Puma concolor (also known as mountain lion, cougar, or puma) and, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, represents the only known breeding population of puma in the eastern United States. Listed as an endangered species in 1967, Florida panthers are gradually making a comeback, growing from fewer than 20 panthers in the 1970s, to more than 200 today. Florida panthers feed primarily on white-tailed deer and wild hogs, but also smaller mammals such as raccoons, armadillos, and rabbits. Ranches are vital to panthers, because few public lands are big enough to support even one adult male panther, which may require up to 500 square kilometers of territory in which to roam and hunt. Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is too small to supply the full territory needs of one panther, yet serves as part of the home range for several. The panthers are caught in a race between the need for territory, and increasing land development as a result of Florida’s rapidly growing population, with some 400 square kilometers of their habitat being lost each year.","Shutter Speed

                                A Rothschild’s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) is transported to safety in a custom-built barge from a flooded Longicharo Island, Lake Baringo, in western Kenya.
                            
                                                    
                                Rothschild’s giraffes are a subspecies of the northern giraffe, and are classified as endangered. The giraffe is the world’s tallest land mammal and the Rothschild’s giraffe is one of the loftiest subspecies, growing up to six meters in height. Longicharo Island was once a peninsula. Rising water levels in Lake Baringo over the past ten years have cut the peninsula off to form an island. Particularly heavy rainfall in 2019 caused further floods, stranding nine giraffes. The local community worked with conservationists from the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Northern Rangelands Trust, and Save Giraffes Now, to build the barge and transport the marooned animals to a sanctuary in the Ruko conservancy on the shores of the lake. The rains had also led to an abundance of food on the island, so edible treats could not be used to entice the giraffes onto the barge. Instead, the giraffes had to be tranquilized, which is a dangerous procedure given their anatomy, as they are at risk of choking on their own saliva, and changes in blood pressure can cause brain damage. A vet was on hand to immediately counteract the drug; the animals were then hooded and led onto the barge with guide ropes.","Shutter Speed

                                Tens of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty-stricken homelands have become stranded in Greece since the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2016. According to a UNHCR report in March 2016, more than one million people, mostly refugees from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, had crossed into Greece since the start of 2015. As Balkan and European countries north of Greece began closing their borders to incoming migrants, more than 90,000 people were left trapped in Greece, in camps or on the streets. Moria Reception and Identification Center on the island of Lesbos, in the eastern Aegean, was the largest refugee camp in Europe, until it burned down in a fire in September 2020. By the summer of 2020, approximately 20,000 people were living in a camp built to accommodate 3,000. Residents complained of rain, cold, illness, lack of food and safety, unsanitary toilets, and water shortages.The fire, which broke out on 9 September, almost completely destroyed the camp. The Greek government said that the fires were started deliberately by migrants protesting that the camp had been put in lockdown as the result of a COVID-19 outbreak. On the nearby island of Samos, at the end of 2019, almost 8,000 refugees were living on a former military base that had been built to hold 650. Islanders held regular protests demanding the transfer of facilities to the mainland, and camp residents protested against their living conditions. On 2 November 2020, fire broke out in the camp, two days after the island was struck by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake. Between 100 and 150 people lost their homes.

                                ‘Reborn’ babies first appeared in the 1990s. Each is unique, carefully crafted by artists known as ‘reborners’. The hyper-realistic reborn babies are created with such details as birthmarks, veins, implanted hair, pores, tears, and saliva. More sophisticated reborns are equipped with electronic systems capable of reproducing the heartbeat, breathing, and sucking of a real baby. Most of the dolls are made of vinyl, though the more realistic ones are made from silicone. Human hair is used for eyelashes, and completed dolls are sometimes perfumed with a ‘new baby’ smell. Reborn babies are available whole and in kit form, and can be purchased online and at fairs. The process of buying a reborn can be done in such a way as to simulate adoption: dolls come with ‘adoption’ or ‘birth’ certificates. Reborn babies have been used in pediatric training to teach students practical childcare skills, and the use of the dolls in care homes has been shown to help reduce disruptive behaviour in people with dementia. While most reborn owners are doll collectors, others have experienced miscarriage, neonatal deaths, have no means for adoption, or suffer from empty nest syndrome, and may use the doll as a substitute for a child.



The photographer wished to explore the phenomenon of how artificial babies evoke genuine emotional response in adults. Each woman portrayed in this project has a personal motivation for having a reborn baby. Some who cannot have, or who have lost, a baby, give their love to an artificial one, looking after them, changing them, and buying them clothes. For some, the dolls are a means of dealing with loss or anxiety; for others they provide companionship.","Shutter Speed

Al-Barghouthi’s wife, Iman Nafi, keeps all her husband’s clothes and belongings in place. Al-Barghouthi was arrested in 1978 after an anti-Israel commando operation.

                                Nearly 4,200 Palestinian security detainees are being held in Israeli prisons, according to a February 2021 report by human rights organization B’Tselem. Some face sentences of 20 years or more. To visit a Palestinian prisoner in an Israeli jail, visitors have to overcome a number of different limitations resulting from border laws, prison regulations, and restrictions set by the Israel Security Agency (ISA). Visitors are usually allowed to see prisoners only through a transparent partition, and talk to them via a telephone receiver. Conjugal visits are denied and physical contact is forbidden, except for children under the age of ten, who are allowed ten minutes at the end of each visit to embrace their fathers. Since the early 2000s, long-term Palestinian detainees hoping to raise families have been smuggling semen out of prison, hidden in gifts to their children. Semen is smuggled in a variety of ways, such as in pen tubes, plastic candy wrappers, and inside bars of chocolate. In February 2021, Middle East Monitor reported that the 96th Palestinian baby had been born using sperm smuggled from Israeli prison.



Habibi, which means ‘my love’ in Arabic, chronicles love stories set against the backdrop of one of the longest and most complicated conflicts in modern history. The photographer aims to show the impact of the conflict on Palestinian families, and the difficulties they face in preserving their reproductive rights and human dignity. The photographer chooses not to focus on war, military action, and weapons, but on people’s refusal to surrender to imprisonment, and on their courage and perseverance to survive in a conflict zone.","Shutter Speed

                                The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe were reported in France on 24 January. Reports of infections in other European countries followed quickly, and on 13 March the World Health Organization declared Europe to be the epicenter of the pandemic. By the end of March, Paris and its suburbs accounted for more than a quarter of the 29,000 confirmed infections in French hospitals, with 1,300 people in intensive care. France went into home lockdown between 17 March and 11 May, with restrictions in Paris being extended to 14 June. Schools, cafés, restaurants, non-essential shops and public buildings were closed, and people outside the home had to carry identification and signed declarations for any travel. Care homes were closed to visitors. Hospitalizations reached a peak in April, with 7,148 people in intensive care, when ICU capacity was only 5,000. Specially converted trains transported patients from overcrowded hospitals to regions that had fewer cases, and the French military airlifted critical cases from eastern France to hospitals in neighboring countries. As the death rate rose, morgues filled to capacity and ad hoc mortuaries were opened in places like the refrigeration hall of Paris’s Rungis wholesale food market. Funeral homes were ordered to bury or cremate bodies immediately, without any ceremony, mortuary preparation, or anyone in attendance.","Shutter Speed

                                Switzerland closed its borders for the first time since the Second World War, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In towns like Riehen and Kreuzlingen, citizens had barely noticed the borders with Germany for decades, and had crossed freely. The closure lasted from 16 March to 15 June. Barrier tapes indicated boundaries that should not be crossed, retracing borders that had been reinforced with barbed wire during the war. In some places, these barriers became meeting places for people who were no longer allowed to be together. Despite regulations to restrict movement and socializing, many individuals found inventive ways to see their loved ones.","Shutter Speed

                                Conflict between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern Caucasus resumed in September, after a lull of 30 years. In the 1980s, as the Soviet Union was crumbling, the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh, part of Azerbaijan, called for independence. Secessionist Armenians and Azerbaijani troops entered into a conflict that intensified during the 1990s, and continued until a ceasefire in 1994. More than 20,000 people died and a million people, both Armenian and Azerbaijani, were displaced. Victorious ethnic Armenians proclaimed a de facto independent state, naming it Artsakh. Over the next 30 years, the two sides maintained a tense coexistence, with periodic military clashes. A July 2020 border clash triggered massive protests in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, with thousands of demonstrators calling for the country to retake Nagorno-Karabakh. Hostilities, which each side blames the other for starting, were renewed on 27 September in what became known as the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Conflict continued until 9 November, the worst fighting the area had seen since the 1990s. In a settlement brokered by Russia in November, the parties agreed to cease hostilities. Azerbaijan regained possession of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent territories of Lachin, Kelbajar and Agdam, but the regional capital, Stepanakert, along with some other territories, remained under ethnic Armenian control. A corridor, patrolled by Russian peacekeepers, will connect Armenia to Stepanakert. Although fighting is over, reconciliation will prove difficult both to Armenians who feel they have lost their homeland and are now displaced, and to Azerbaijanis returning to a region ravaged by war.","Shutter Speed

                                Major General Qasem Soleimani (62) was killed on 3 January at Baghdad airport, along with other Iran-backed militia figures, in an air strike ordered by US president Donald Trump. The US had pursued Soleimani for years, claiming that operations in neighboring Iraq had killed hundreds of American military personnel, and the Pentagon said the air strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. Much of Soleimani’s career had been spent at the top of Iran’s Quds Force— the foreign operations wing of the elite paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In recent years, the US had seen him as the mastermind behind Iran’s expanded influence in proxy conflicts stretching from Iraq and Lebanon to Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Some regional analysts considered him to be the second most powerful man in Iran, after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Soleimani was dubbed a ‘living martyr of the revolution’ by the supreme leader. Millions of Iranians attended funeral ceremonies for him.","Shutter Speed

                                Nurses wound plastic around the body and sprayed it with disinfectant, in accordance with Indonesian government protocols. These protocols required COVID-19 victims to be wrapped in plastic and buried quickly to prevent the virus spreading. This meant grieving relatives were unable to follow funeral practices, which for Muslims includes personally washing the dead. The World Health Organization advised against the use of disinfectant and recommended wrapping bodies in cloth. The potential risk of transmission related to the handling of bodies of COVID-19 victims is considered low, provided that it is carried out by trained medical staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Around the world, COVID-19 matters were aggravated by misinformation and inadequate reporting. For many, the lack of access to factual evidence and accurate science-based messages about the disease led to confusion, anxiety, and denial. When this image was published it sparked denial and strong reaction across social media. Many who saw it declared it to be a set-up intended to spread fear.

                                This was the first hug Rosa had received in five months. In March, care homes across the country had closed their doors to all visitors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing millions of Brazilians from visiting their elderly relatives. Carers were ordered to keep physical contact with the vulnerable to an absolute minimum. At Viva Bem, a simple invention, ‘The Hug Curtain', allowed people to hug each other once again. The new coronavirus had first appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and by January 2020 had begun to spread around the world. On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The disease—transmitted mainly via close contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols—could be fatal, and people over the age of 70 were one of the groups considered most vulnerable. Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed claims about the severity of the pandemic and the danger posed by the virus, undermined quarantine measures adopted at state level, and encouraged Brazilians to continue working to keep the economy afloat. Brazil ended 2020 with one of the worst records globally in dealing with the virus, with some 7.7 million reported cases and 195,000 deaths.","Shutter Speed

                                Spain is one of the four largest global exporters of pork, alongside Germany, the US, and Denmark. The European Union as a whole consumes around 20 million tons of pork annually, and exports some 13 percent of its total production, mostly to East Asia, in particular to China. An EU-funded campaign, Let’s Talk About Pork, has been launched in Spain, France, and Portugal, giving its objective as a drive to counter fake claims surrounding meat production and the consumption of pork in Europe, and to demonstrate that the sector meets the highest standards of sustainability, biosecurity, and food safety in the world. Such standards include guarantees that animals do not suffer pain, and that they have enough space to move freely. Animal rights groups, on the other hand, argue that such practices as routine tail-docking and narrow gestation crates for sows constitute animal abuse, and that animal pain and suffering is widespread. Animal rights investigators say that the industry makes access to farms difficult, and that they are compelled to gain access to such facilities covertly, often at night, in order to document what happens inside. These photographs were taken on a number of such incursions, on different dates, at various facilities across Spain.","Shutter Speed

                                As Himalayan snows dwindle and glaciers recede, communities in the Ladakh region of northern India are building huge ice cones that provide water into summer. Ladakh is a cold desert, with winter temperatures reaching -30°C, and an average rainfall of around 100 millimeters. Most villages face acute water shortages, particularly during the crucial planting season in April and May. Tourism and population growth are adding to water demand. In 2013, Sonam Wangchuk, a Ladakhi engineer and innovator, came up with a form of glacier-grafting that creates artificial glaciers in the form of conical ice heaps, resembling Buddhist religious stupas. The ice stupas store winter meltwater and slowly release it for the growing season in spring, when it is most needed for crops. The stupas are created in winter, when water is carried down from higher ground in underground pipes. The final section rises vertically, and the difference in height causes water to fountain outwards, in subzero temperatures, freezing to form a stupa. Stupas were established in 26 villages in 2020, and a pipeline is under construction to create 50 more. Stupa creator Wangchuk says that the stupas stand for a final attempt of Himalayan mountain communities to fight the climate crisis, but should not be considered as a solution to the challenge: that remains the responsibility of national governments, and people adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles to reduce emissions.","Shutter Speed

According to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, there were triple the number of fires in 2020 compared to 2019. Fires in the Pantanal tend to burn just below the surface, fueled by highly combustible peat, which means they burn for longer and are harder to extinguish. The Pantanal, which is recognized by UNESCO as a World Biosphere Reserve and is one of Brazil’s most important biomes, is suffering its worst drought in nearly 50 years, causing fires to spread out of control. Many of the fires started from slash-and-burn farming, which has become more prevalent due to the weakening of conservation regulation and enforcement under President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. The Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has seen its funding reduced by around 30 percent. Bolsonaro has frequently spoken out against environmental protection measures, and has made repeated comments undermining Brazilian courts’ attempts to punish offenders. Environmentalists say that this is encouraging agricultural burning and creating a climate of impunity. Luciana Leite, who studies humanity’s relationship with nature at the Federal University of Bahia, predicts the total collapse of the Pantanal, if current climate trends and anti-environmental policies persist.",,,,,"Camera

A 2016 World Bank report states that the climate crisis poses a number of threats to the Sundarbans, including rising sea levels and the frequency and intensity of storms. Satellites have found the sea advancing by 200 meters a year in parts of the region. Academic studies indicate an estimated 20 million people living along the Bangladesh coast are affected by salinity in drinking water. More than half of the coastal areas are impacted by salinity, which reduces soil productivity and vegetation growth, degrading the environment and impacting people’s lives and livelihoods. Rice paddies and cultivable land are converted to shrimp farms, which further contribute to groundwater salinity and soil degradation.","Shutter Speed

                                Hpakant is the site of the world’s biggest jade mine, and is the largest supplier of jadeite, the more valuable of the two forms of jade. Demand from China, where jade is a popular status symbol, fuels the industry. Global Witness reported Myanmar’s jade trade to be worth US$31 billion in 2014 alone—nearly half the country’s GDP—and that the sector appeared to be controlled by networks of military elites, drug lords, and crony companies. The National League for Democracy (NLD) government has made promises to tackle problems in the sector, but progress has been slow. Companies do not fulfill government requirements to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to international standards, and officials allegedly lack the capacity to assess EIAs. Destruction of the environment by mining operations includes indiscriminate vegetation loss, degradation of farmland, and river sedimentation, and is mainly a result of inappropriate mining practices. At Hpakant sites, issues include illegally high heaps of mining waste, vast abandoned mining pits, and companies failing to stabilize deep excavations. Landslides are frequent, including a mudslide after heavy rainfall in July 2020 that killed at least 100 people.","Shutter Speed

                                California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are playful animals, native to western North America. With COVID-19 lockdowns in place across California, outdoor and natural beauty spots with plenty of wildlife became a popular focus for local travel. In many countries the wearing of face masks outdoors was obligatory. Similar destinations around the world became littered with abandoned masks. The BBC reported an estimated 129 billion disposable face masks and 65 billion throwaway gloves being used each month through the pandemic. Such personal protective equipment (PPE) can be mistaken for food by birds, fish, marine mammals, and other animals. PPE also contains plastic, and so contributes to the eight million tons of plastic that end up in the oceans every year. According to World Animal Protection, every year an estimated 136,000 seals, sea lions, and whales die from plastic entanglement. Surgical masks break down into millions of microplastic particles over time, which are eaten by fish and other animals, and therefore carry contamination back up the food chain, potentially also affecting humans.","Shutter Speed

India’s National Register of Citizens (NRC), a register containing names of all ‘genuine’ Indian citizens, was first prepared in 1951 to deal with issues regarding illegal migrants in the border state of Assam. In 2019, the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) proposed that the register be extended to cover the whole of India, and on 12 December 2019, parliament passed a Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to this effect. The new law allowed Hindus and other non-Muslims in Assam who were unable to prove their citizenship status to be included in the NRC, but left Muslims off the registry. This sparked peaceful protests locally, which spread nationwide. In late February 2020, protests turned to rioting in areas of North East Delhi, in what became the worst sectarian violence in the Indian capital in decades. At least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and property was destroyed.","Shutter Speed

                                In August 2014, the group known as Islamic State (IS) launched an attack on the heartland of the Yazidi community at the foot of Sinjar Mountain, in northern Iraq. IS sees Yazidis as heretics and therefore a valid target for extermination, in their vision of a new caliphate ruled by Sharia law. From 2014 until US and Iraqi forces began liberating the region in 2017, a slavery economy operated in IS-held territory. In recent years, reports have emerged across the media of women and children handed out as gifts and sold as slaves, for a stipend of around US$50 per slave and US$35 per child. In May 2020, Associated Press reported that although some 3,500 slaves had been freed, most ransomed by their families, some 2,900 Yazidis remained unaccounted for. The United Nations has called the attacks an act of genocide against the minority group. The independent Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), which has been investigating IS in Iraq since 2015, has now built up a substantial body of evidence and first-hand witness accounts in order to construct case files that identify ranking IS members as responsible for atrocities, including genocide and other crimes against humanity.","Shutter Speed

                                The people of Sakha, a republic in the far northeast of the Russian Federation, live in a remote area with extreme weather conditions: temperatures can drop as low as -50°C in winter. Although Sakha, which is also known as Yakutia, extends over more than three million square kilometers, its population numbers barely 950,000 people, around 50 percent of whom are ethnic Sakha (or Yakuts). Art has become a way of showcasing and preserving Sakha culture, traditions, and stories. Cinema has flourished there since the 1990s. Around seven to ten feature films are shot a year, by a local movie industry lightheartedly dubbed ‘Sakhawood’. Genres range from romantic comedies and crime movies to fairy tales and local legends. Most movies are made in the Yakut language, and subtitled in Russian. Production budgets range from US$12,000 to US$120,000. Many actors have no professional training, although some have worked in theater, and directors and camera crew frequently attend film school in Moscow or elsewhere. The films are enormously popular locally but have also met wider success. In recent years, Sakha cinema has been represented in film festivals in Finland and South Korea, among others, and the films have picked up numerous awards.","Shutter Speed

                                The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War began on 27 September, and conflict continued until 9 November. It was the worst fighting between ethnic Armenian forces and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in the 1990s. The first war ended in an uneasy ceasefire, with ethnic Armenian forces gaining control over a further seven territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh, and proclaiming a de facto independent state, Artsakh. The two sides maintained a tense coexistence, with periodic military clashes which escalated into war in 2020. In a settlement brokered by Russia in November, the parties agreed to cease hostilities. Azerbaijan regained possession of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent territories of Lachin, Kelbajar and Agdam, but the regional capital, Stepanakert, along with certain other territories, were left under ethnic Armenian control. A corridor, patrolled by Russian peacekeepers, will connect Armenia to Stepanakert.","Shutter Speed

                                Animal-assisted therapy, also known as pet therapy, is used in many clinical environments, especially in psychological therapy and palliative care. Animals appear to be able to reduce anxiety and stress, and also to have physical effects, such as lowering blood pressure, improving heart rate, or helping in pain management. In hospices, the aim is to use the natural bond between humans and animals to provide comfort, peace, and companionship to terminally ill patients. Horses seem particularly suited for palliative care as they are especially in tune with their surroundings. Peyo works with his trainer Hassen Bouchakour at Les Sabots du Coeur, an organization devoted to animal-assisted therapy, and to scientific research into the subject. He supports around 20 patients each month, and scientists are now studying his instinctive ability to detect cancers and tumors.","Shutter Speed

                                Fatima has nine children. In order to provide for them, she makes a living from fishing. Although her village was devastated by armed conflict in Yemen, Fatima returned to resume her livelihood, buying a boat with money she earned from selling fish. The conflict—between Houthi Shia Muslim rebels and a Sunni Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia—dates from 2014, and has led to what UNICEF has termed the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Some 20.1 million people (almost two-thirds of the population) required food assistance at the beginning of 2020, with approximately 80 percent of the population relying on humanitarian aid. A Saudi coalition blockade on Yemen between 2015 and 2017 imposed import restrictions on food, medicines, and fuel. Resulting shortages exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. In many cases, conditions of near-famine were caused not so much by the unavailability of food, but because it became unaffordable, priced out of reach to most Yemenis by import restrictions, soaring transport costs due to fuel scarcity, a collapsing currency, and other man-made supply disruptions. In 2020 conflict intensified, and the situation was made worse by unprecedented heavy rainfall, which made some 300,000 people homeless, locust infestations that destroyed crops, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shutter Speed

                                Young people make up more than half of Algeria’s population, and according to a UNESCO report 72% of people under 30 in Algeria are unemployed. Pivotal moments in Algerian history, such as the ‘Black October’ revolt of 1988, have had angry youth at their core. Black October was harshly suppressed—more than 500 people were killed in five days—and was followed by a ‘black decade’ of violence and unrest. Thirty years on, the effects of that decade are still present. In a traumatized country, high unemployment leads to boredom and frustration in everyday life and many young people feel disconnected from the state and its institutions. Football, for many young men, becomes both an identity and a means of escape, with quasi-political groups of fans known as ‘Ultras’ playing a large and sometimes violent role in protests. In neglected working-class neighborhoods such as Bab el-Oued in Algiers, young people often seek refuge in diki—private places that are ‘bubbles of freedom’ away from the gaze of society and from conservative social values. But the sense of community and solidarity is often not enough to erase the trials of poor living conditions. In February 2019, thousands of young people from working-class neighborhoods again took to the streets in what became a nationwide challenge to the reign of long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

Kho (the word means ‘brother’ in colloquial North-African Arabic) is about the genesis of a revolt. It is the story of the deep unease of youth, who, by daring to challenge authority, inspired the rest of the population to join their action, giving birth to the largest protest movement in Algeria in decades.","Shutter Speed

                                On 10 March, Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 MAX, disappeared from the radar six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa airport and crashed into a field, killing all 157 people on board. The impact was so great that both engines were buried in a crater 10 meters deep.  A week after the crash, empty coffins were buried at a ceremony at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, as victims were unable to be identified. Officials gave relatives bags of earth from the crash site. On 14 November, eight months after the crash, the site of the impact was covered and the unidentified remains of victims buried in rows of identical coffins. Comparisons were made with the crash of a Lion Air aircraft, also a 737 MAX, 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018. Countries across the world, initially with the exception of the US, grounded the 737 MAX. First reports showed that pilots had been unable to prevent the plane repeatedly nosediving, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. It appeared that in both cases pilots were struggling to deal with an automated safety system designed to prevent stalling, which was repeatedly pushing the nose of the plane down. It seemed that the system was being activated, possibly due to a faulty sensor, even though nothing was wrong. It later emerged that American Airlines pilots had confronted Boeing about potential safety issues with the MAX. Boeing had resisted their calls but promised a software fix, which had not been done by the time Flight ET302 crashed. Planes remained grounded into 2020.","Shutter Speed

                                Protests began in Hong Kong at the end of March in response to government proposals to amend existing legislation and allow extradition to mainland China. Anti-government demonstrations gathered momentum over the following weeks as pro-democracy groups united, with students playing a large role in protests and in human-chain rallies. On 12 June, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered around the Legislative Council building ahead of a debate on the extradition laws, and met with violent opposition from police. Protests continued to escalate, both in frequency and size, as did police countermeasures. The authorities banned the wearing of face masks, and at a demonstration on 1 October, the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People’s Republic of China, police fired live ammunition at protesters for the first time. After initially proposing postponements and amendments to legislation, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam eventually announced that she would withdraw the bill. This was done on 23 October, but protesters’ demands had broadened to include implementation of genuine universal suffrage and release of arrested protestors, and unrest continued into 2020.","Shutter Speed

                                A view over Algiers, Algeria.
                            
                                                    
                                Young people make up more than half of Algeria’s population, and according to a UNESCO report 72% of people under 30 in Algeria are unemployed. Pivotal moments in Algerian history, such as the ‘Black October’ revolt of 1988, have had angry youth at their core. Black October was harshly suppressed—more than 500 people were killed in five days—and was followed by a ‘black decade’ of violence and unrest. Thirty years on, the effects of that decade are still present. In a traumatized country, high unemployment leads to boredom and frustration in everyday life and many young people feel disconnected from the state and its institutions. Football, for many young men, becomes both an identity and a means of escape, with quasi-political groups of fans known as ‘Ultras’ playing a large and sometimes violent role in protests. In neglected working-class neighborhoods such as Bab el-Oued in Algiers, young people often seek refuge in diki—private places that are ‘bubbles of freedom’ away from the gaze of society and from conservative social values. But the sense of community and solidarity is often not enough to erase the trials of poor living conditions. In February 2019, thousands of young people from working-class neighborhoods again took to the streets in what became a nationwide challenge to the reign of long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

Kho (the word means ‘brother’ in colloquial North-African Arabic) is about the genesis of a revolt. It is the story of the deep unease of youth, who, by daring to challenge authority, inspired the rest of the population to join their action, giving birth to the largest protest movement in Algeria in decades.","Shutter Speed

                                Protests in Sudan began in December 2018 and spread rapidly throughout the country. By April 2019, protesters were staging a sit-in close to army headquarters in the capital Khartoum, and demanding an end to the 30-year rule of dictator Omar al-Bashir. On 11 April, al-Bashir was removed from office in a military coup, and a transitional military government was established. Protests continued, calling for power to be handed to civilian groups. On 3 June, government forces opened fire on unarmed protesters. Scores of people were killed and many more subject to further violence. Three days later the African Union suspended Sudan, in the midst of widespread international condemnation of the attack. The authorities sought to defuse protests by imposing blackouts, and shutting down the internet. Protesters communicated by text message, word of mouth and using megaphones, and resistance to military rule continued. Despite another severe crackdown on 30 June, the pro-democracy movement was eventually successful in signing a power-sharing agreement with the military, on 17 August.","Shutter Speed

                                By early 2019, the territory held by the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria had reduced to a four-square-kilometer patch in the southeast, centered on the village of Baghuz. The IS retreat from northern Syria took place under the onslaught of the combined militias of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) and supported by an international coalition of primarily US troops. As IS drew back, tens of thousands of people emerged from the enclave, many of them the wives and children of foreign IS fighters. Numerous IS fighters themselves surrendered or were captured. The Kurds were left with the conundrum of what to do with so many prisoners, many of them under 18 and orphaned or separated from their families. Then, at the beginning of October, US president Donald Trump ordered US troops out of northern Syria. On 9 October, Turkey—which regarded Kurdish forces on its border as a security threat, given the decades-long Kurdish insurgency against Turkey—invaded northern Syria, aiming to end Kurdish control over the territory. As Kurdish forces refocused their attention on a new opponent, the fate of the many thousands of prisoners grew even more uncertain.","Shutter Speed

                                Resignation Syndrome (RS) renders patients passive, immobile, mute, unable to eat and drink, incontinent and unresponsive to physical stimulus. It affects psychologically traumatized children in the midst of lengthy asylum processes, and seems most common in Roma and Yazidi children as well as those from the Balkans. It was first noted in the late 1990s, and was thought to be confined to Sweden, though cases have since been reported in the offshore refugee detention center run by the Australian government in Nauru. Remission and gradual return to normal function occurs after life circumstances improve. Ewa succumbed to RS while her family were trying for asylum in Sweden and threatened with deportation to Poland, which had been their country of first arrival as refugees. They feared being sent back to Armenia. The family was deported to Poland, despite Ewa’s illness, but she recovered eight months after they arrived.","Shutter Speed

                                Algeria had been embroiled in protests since February. Initially, protests had been aimed at ousting long-time president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, an 81-year-old veteran of Algeria’s independence struggle who had been in ill-health and not seen in public for some time. Bouteflika resigned in April, handing over to a military-backed caretaker government, but demonstrations continued. Protesters demanded the cancellation of the presidential elections set to take place on 4 July and a return to civilian democracy. They also called for the departure of government officials associated with the Bouteflika administration, including the interim president and prime minister. Protests continued into 2020 without successful resolution.","Shutter Speed

                                On 10 March, Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 MAX, disappeared from the radar six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa airport and crashed into a field, killing all 157 people on board. The impact was so great that both engines were buried in a crater 10 meters deep.  A week after the crash, empty coffins were buried at a ceremony at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, as victims were unable to be identified. Officials gave relatives bags of earth from the crash site. On 14 November, eight months after the crash, the site of the impact was covered and the unidentified remains of victims buried in rows of identical coffins. Comparisons were made with the crash of a Lion Air aircraft, also a 737 MAX, 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018. Countries across the world, initially with the exception of the US, grounded the 737 MAX. First reports showed that pilots had been unable to prevent the plane repeatedly nosediving, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. It appeared that in both cases pilots were struggling to deal with an automated safety system designed to prevent stalling, which was repeatedly pushing the nose of the plane down. It seemed that the system was being activated, possibly due to a faulty sensor, even though nothing was wrong. It later emerged that American Airlines pilots had confronted Boeing about potential safety issues with the MAX. Boeing had resisted their calls but promised a software fix, which had not been done by the time Flight ET302 crashed. Planes remained grounded into 2020.","Shutter Speed

                                At least 20 people were killed and 47 injured in a terrorist attack outside a cancer hospital in the Kasr al-Aini area of central Cairo, Egypt, on 5 August. Egypt’s Ministry of Interior said a car carrying a bomb drove into oncoming traffic and collided with three others, triggering the explosion and a fire that forced the evacuation of nearby buildings, including the hospital. Interior Minister Mahmoud Tawfik said that the car had been packed with explosives intended for use in terrorist attacks elsewhere. The Egyptian government put blame for the attack on the Islamist Hasm Movement, a violent breakaway faction of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was once the country’s largest Islamist group, but has been banned in Egypt since 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood itself has repeatedly distanced itself from the Hasm Movement and its violence. The Hasm Movement has carried out a string of attacks in Cairo in the past, but mostly against security forces and not civilians.","Shutter Speed

                                The annual fire season in Australia began early and was exceptionally severe—following months of record-breaking drought and fanned by strong winds. Far stronger wildfires than usual, mostly battled by volunteer firefighters, raged through New South Wales and Victoria as well as areas in South Australia and Queensland, laying waste to bushland and rainforest and destroying homes. By the end of January 2020, more than 30 people had been killed, 3,000 homes lost, and around 12.6 million hectares of land burned (nearly three times the size of the Netherlands). Wildlife was harshly hit. Local scientists estimated that up to one billion animals perished, and more than 50% of the Gondwana rainforest traversing New South Wales and Queensland was burned. In December, while the intensity and speed at which many bushfires were spreading increased, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison went on holiday to Hawaii, and was prompted to return only after the death of two volunteer firefighters. He continued to champion a pro-fossil-fuel policy and held back from linking the fires to the climate crisis.","Shutter Speed

                                Rescue workers search through debris at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the day after the plane crashed.
                            
                                                    
                                On 10 March, Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 MAX, disappeared from the radar six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa airport and crashed into a field, killing all 157 people on board. The impact was so great that both engines were buried in a crater 10 meters deep.  A week after the crash, empty coffins were buried at a ceremony at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, as victims were unable to be identified. Officials gave relatives bags of earth from the crash site. On 14 November, eight months after the crash, the site of the impact was covered and the unidentified remains of victims buried in rows of identical coffins. Comparisons were made with the crash of a Lion Air aircraft, also a 737 MAX, 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018. Countries across the world, initially with the exception of the US, grounded the 737 MAX. First reports showed that pilots had been unable to prevent the plane repeatedly nosediving, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. It appeared that in both cases pilots were struggling to deal with an automated safety system designed to prevent stalling, which was repeatedly pushing the nose of the plane down. It seemed that the system was being activated, possibly due to a faulty sensor, even though nothing was wrong. It later emerged that American Airlines pilots had confronted Boeing about potential safety issues with the MAX. Boeing had resisted their calls but promised a software fix, which had not been done by the time Flight ET302 crashed. Planes remained grounded into 2020.","Shutter Speed

                                Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama in the northern Bahamas on 1 September, reaching Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and breaking records as the strongest Atlantic hurricane to directly impact a land mass. Punishing winds and rising floodwaters devastated homes, crippled hospitals, and downed electricity supplies. At least 71 people were killed and 9,000 homes affected, impacting some 29,500 people. A report by the Inter-American Development Bank put damage caused by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas at US$3.4 billion, equal to about a quarter of the island nation’s annual economic output. Although scientists are uncertain whether the climate crisis will lead to an increase in the number of hurricanes, warmer ocean temperatures are expected to intensify wind speeds and higher sea levels could make the impact of landfall more damaging.","Shutter Speed

The Somalia-based Islamist extremist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement that called it a response to US president Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The DusitD2 complex houses a number of international companies, and is frequented by government officials and foreign visitors, making it a target that would draw media attention. The attack and subsequent security operation lasted 20 hours, and ended with all five attackers being killed.","Shutter Speed

                                Algeria had been embroiled in protests since February. Initially, protests had been aimed at ousting long-time president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, an 81-year-old veteran of Algeria’s independence struggle who had been in ill-health and not seen in public for some time. Bouteflika resigned in April, handing over to a military-backed caretaker government, but demonstrations continued. Protesters demanded the cancellation of the presidential elections set to take place on 4 July and a return to civilian democracy. They also called for the departure of government officials associated with the Bouteflika administration, including the interim president and prime minister. Protests continued into 2020 without successful resolution.","Shutter Speed

Seniors are particularly vulnerable to loneliness, with 15% of elderly men who live alone having fewer than one conversation in two weeks, according to a report in The Japan Times. Rugby not only keeps the players active, but offers a ready-made social life.

The project, established by the Plan International organization, aims to empower women by promoting self-confidence, widening educational opportunities, and through advocacy against early marriage. Following the 2019 Women’s World Cup, there was an international surge of interest in women’s football, and projects like the one in Benin can be seen as part of a wider view of the power of sport to unify and spread social awareness. In January 2019, Benin hosted a delegation from FIFA, football’s international governing body, aimed at supporting a new sports strategy in schools, and Beninese president Patrice Talon announced plans for four new football schools, including one for women.","Shutter Speed

Paradise was almost completely burnt to the ground, and 90% of its population were dispersed to towns and cities across the US, but the fire stopped at the edge of Paradise High School’s football field, sparing it and the surrounding sports buildings.

The subjects of the portraits chose their own locations, and closed their eyes to emphasize their connection to the landscape.","Shutter Speed

                                Natalia (62) was pregnant at the time of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Although the baby was born healthy, she didn’t dare risk another pregnancy as she feared the effects of radiation. She also felt she could not cope with two children, so had an abortion the second time she conceived.
                            
                                                    
                                Belarus abortion laws allow termination on request up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, and in certain medical or social circumstances up to 28 weeks, which places them among the most liberal in Europe. Nevertheless, abortion is still a taboo for many women, and many are reluctant to admit they have had a termination. ‘No abortion week’ campaigns are held annually, and the decision to have a termination is often accompanied by a sense of shame. In this project, Belarusian women who have considered or undergone abortion tell their stories. The women had a range of concerns behind their decisions surrounding abortion—from contamination after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to fear of poverty, not wanting to be a single parent, or a background of sexual abuse. As their decisions were often made with difficulty, in this story they did not want to show their faces and their names have been changed.","Shutter Speed

                                As the Islamic State group (IS) retreated from territory around Mosul in northern Iraq, thousands of former IS prisoners were liberated, many in severe states of trauma. The photographer took posed portraits of displaced Yazidi people and other minorities who had suffered human rights violations perpetrated by IS, in camps for displaced people in northern Iraq. The Yazidi religion is monotheistic and can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamian and Abrahamic roots. Due to their unique beliefs, the Yazidi people were seen by the Sunnis of IS as ‘devil worshippers’. When IS occupied ancestral Yazidi lands in northern Iraq in 2014, IS fighters massacred around 5,000 Yazidi men. Women and girls were abducted and forced into sexual slavery, and boys forced to train as child soldiers. Some 500,000 Yazidis were displaced. Many now live in refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan and Nineveh Governorate in Iraq. Jan Kizilhan, a psychologist working in one such camp at a center for people who survived the atrocities, points to the effects of this severe personal and cultural trauma. These include feelings of helplessness and powerlessness, tension, and a variety of physical illnesses.",,,,,,2020 Photo Contest, 1st Prize, Portraits, Stories,{'Jan Kizilhan'},"{'the Khanke IDP Camp', 'Islamic State'}",1.0,2.0,"{'Mosul', 'Iraqi Kurdistan', 'Kurdistan', 'Dohuk', 'Iraq', 'Yazidi', 'Nineveh'}",7.0

                                Resignation Syndrome (RS) renders patients passive, immobile, mute, unable to eat and drink, incontinent and unresponsive to physical stimulus. It affects psychologically traumatized children in the midst of lengthy asylum processes, and seems most common in Roma and Yazidi children as well as those from the Balkans. It was first noted in the late 1990s, and was thought to be confined to Sweden, though cases have since been reported in the offshore refugee detention center run by the Australian government in Nauru. Remission and gradual return to normal function occurs after life circumstances improve. Ewa succumbed to RS while her family were trying for asylum in Sweden and threatened with deportation to Poland, which had been their country of first arrival as refugees. They feared being sent back to Armenia. The family was deported to Poland, despite Ewa’s illness, but she recovered eight months after they arrived.","Shutter Speed

                                Wolverines are elusive, solitary animals that inhabit remote tundra and snow forests in the northern latitudes of Europe, Asia and North America. They can travel up to 25 kilometers a day in search of food. Tenacious predators, they prey on smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents, but may try for bulkier quarry such as caribou if the prey appears injured. They also feed opportunistically on larger corpses and have been known to dig into burrows and eat hibernating animals. Large snowshoe-like paws and hydrophobic fur coats equip them well for life in the snow: the Iñupiat people of northern Alaska particularly value the fur for lining parka rims, but the practice is declining following discouragement from conservationists. Although the fur trade is decreasing, current challenges to wolverines include the possible diminishing of spring snow cover due to climate change, exacerbated by their vast territory requirements and low reproductive rate.","Shutter Speed

                                Pangolins are scaly-skinned mammals, and while sometimes mistaken for reptiles, they are more closely related to dogs and bears than anteaters or armadillos. They range through Asia and parts of Africa, and vary from the size of a domestic cat to over a meter long. They are solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which are raised for around two years. Pangolin scales are highly prized in some parts of Asia for traditional medicine, and the meat is considered a delicacy. A 2017 report by Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring network, states that pangolins are currently the most illegally traded animals in the world, with at least one million estimated to have been poached in the last ten years. All eight pangolin species are protected under national and international laws, and two are officially listed as critically endangered.","Shutter Speed

                                Indonesia’s orangutans are under severe threat from the ongoing depletion of the rainforest. Sumatran orangutans, which once ranged over the entire island of Sumatra, are now restricted to the north and critically endangered. They are almost exclusively arboreal: females virtually never travel on the ground and adult males do so rarely. As logging, mining, and palm oil cultivation increase, orangutans find themselves squeezed into smaller pockets of forest, forced out of their natural habitat and in more frequent conflict with humans. Organizations such as the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP) care for lost, injured and captive orangutans, aiming to reintroduce them into the wild. Human caregivers take on the maternal role that female orangutans play, aiming to reintroduce young to their natural habitat at around the age of seven or eight, when they would naturally leave their mothers in the wild.","Shutter Speed

The species has been brought to the brink of extinction by a number of factors, including the fragmentation of its forest habitat and subsequent genetic isolation, being poached for its fur, and a decreasing food base. Rabbits, their staple diet, have been almost eliminated from the area by rabbit hemorrhagic disease. A lynx population of some 5,000 in the early 1960s has been reduced to a few hundred, but recent surveys by the World Wildlife Fund indicate that numbers are slowly on the rise following conservation efforts.","Shutter Speed

                                During the 1980s, in the midst of the 1960–1996 Guatemalan Civil War, the state-backed military identified all indigenous Maya peoples as guerilla supporters. The Ixil Maya community, who live near the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes in western Guatemala, were the targets of a genocide operation. The Ixil were subject to systematic rape, forced displacement, starvation and massacre. By 1996, some 7,000 Ixil had been killed. The violence was particularly extreme from 1979–1985 as successive administrations and the military pursued a scorched-earth policy in the region. A United Nations truth commission later revealed that between 70% and 90% of Ixil villages had been burned to the ground and some 60% of the population forced to flee to the mountains. Victims of the military were often buried in clandestine mass graves, while many survivors in mountain areas, isolated from health care, died from malnutrition and treatable diseases. In 2013, Jose Efraín Ríos Montt, who ruled Guatemala in 1982 and 1983, was tried for genocide and crimes against humanity. Although found guilty, he was acquitted at a second trial—which cited procedural errors unrelated to any of the testimony—and died unpunished five years later. Nevertheless, the trial was seen as a milestone in holding those responsible for the atrocities to account, and as a contribution to an accurate account of what happened in the civil war. Today, many survivors are still searching for the remains of their dead relatives. Exhumations play an important role in gathering evidence of civilian massacres and in reconciling survivors with their grief, as they are at last able to give their loved ones a dignified burial.

 

The photographer has lived in Guatemala for 13 years and worked as a volunteer with the Recuperation of Historical Memory project, listening to the stories of Guatemalan people. He sees this photo project as his contribution to fortifying the historical memory of the country, as a tool for Guatemalan people so they do not forget.","Shutter Speed

                                Muslims who completely memorize the Qur’an are allowed to use the title ‘Hafız’ before their names. They believe that whoever memorizes the holy book and follows its teachings will be rewarded by Allah and will rise in status in Paradise. The practice dates back to the days when illiteracy was widespread and paper and vellum were prohibitively expensive, so hafızes were seen as guardians of the holy word, keeping it alive for future generations. The Qur’an has 6,236 verses, and committing them to memory is usually achieved by repetition and recitation. In Turkey, thousands of Qur’an schools exist for this purpose and many are attended by girls. Ranging in age from eight to 17 years old, most take three or four years to complete a task that requires discipline, devotion and focus. After graduating, most of these girls marry and have families but still retain the holy text word for word.

 The photographer attended a Qur’an school with her twin sister when they were 12, and so is able to reveal a world unknown to many. Her project follows the daily lives of students at Qur’an schools and shows not only their journey to become hafızes, but also how they retain the dreams and adventurous nature of young women their age, as well as the rule-breaking practices and the fun of school life when they are not studying.","Shutter Speed

                                A view over Algiers, Algeria.
                            
                                                    
                                Young people make up more than half of Algeria’s population, and according to a UNESCO report 72% of people under 30 in Algeria are unemployed. Pivotal moments in Algerian history, such as the ‘Black October’ revolt of 1988, have had angry youth at their core. Black October was harshly suppressed—more than 500 people were killed in five days—and was followed by a ‘black decade’ of violence and unrest. Thirty years on, the effects of that decade are still present. In a traumatized country, high unemployment leads to boredom and frustration in everyday life and many young people feel disconnected from the state and its institutions. Football, for many young men, becomes both an identity and a means of escape, with quasi-political groups of fans known as ‘Ultras’ playing a large and sometimes violent role in protests. In neglected working-class neighborhoods such as Bab el-Oued in Algiers, young people often seek refuge in diki—private places that are ‘bubbles of freedom’ away from the gaze of society and from conservative social values. But the sense of community and solidarity is often not enough to erase the trials of poor living conditions. In February 2019, thousands of young people from working-class neighborhoods again took to the streets in what became a nationwide challenge to the reign of long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
Kho (the word means ‘brother’ in colloquial North-African Arabic) is about the genesis of a revolt. It is the story of the deep unease of youth, who, by daring to challenge authority, inspired the rest of the population to join their action, giving birth to the largest protest movement in Algeria in decades.","Shutter Speed

                                By early 2019, the territory held by the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria had reduced to a four-square-kilometer patch in the southeast, centered on the village of Baghuz. The IS retreat from northern Syria took place under the onslaught of the combined militias of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) and supported by an international coalition of primarily US troops. As IS drew back, tens of thousands of people emerged from the enclave, many of them the wives and children of foreign IS fighters. Numerous IS fighters themselves surrendered or were captured. The Kurds were left with the conundrum of what to do with so many prisoners, many of them under 18 and orphaned or separated from their families. Then, at the beginning of October, US president Donald Trump ordered US troops out of northern Syria. On 9 October, Turkey—which regarded Kurdish forces on its border as a security threat, given the decades-long Kurdish insurgency against Turkey—invaded northern Syria, aiming to end Kurdish control over the territory. As Kurdish forces refocused their attention on a new opponent, the fate of the many thousands of prisoners grew even more uncertain.","Shutter Speed

                                In the most extensive civil unrest in Chile’s recent history, people rose throughout the year in protest against economic inequality. Despite being one of the region’s most prosperous nations, Chile is the most unequal country in the OECD group of nations, according to a United Nations report. Just 1% of its population controls 33% of its wealth. The trigger for the unrest was an increase in subway fares instigated by President Sebastián Piñera on 18 October. A peaceful rally in the capital Santiago sparked further protests leading to a nationwide uprising. Demands grew to include comprehensive  economic reform and the replacement of the constitution, which was drawn up during the reign of Augusto Pinochet in the 1980s and which created a legal basis for a market-driven economy and privatized pensions, health and education. Demonstrations grew in size—the largest comprising more than one million people on 25 October—and became increasingly violent. According to Human Rights Watch, the authorities used excessive force against demonstrators, including pellet shotguns that caused numerous eye injuries, and were accused of abuse, including rape, of people in detention. Women played a prominent role in the demonstrations, particularly after reports of human-rights and sexual offences against female protesters by security forces. On 15 November President Piñera announced a referendum on a new constitution to be held in 2020, but unrest continued with demands for an inquiry into human rights violations during the protests and an immediate overhaul of the pension, health and education systems.","Shutter Speed

Anti-government demonstrations gathered momentum over the following weeks as pro-democracy groups united, with students playing a large role in protests and in human-chain rallies. On 12 June, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered around the Legislative Council building ahead of a debate on the extradition laws, and met with violent opposition from police. Protests continued to escalate, both in frequency and size, as did police countermeasures. The authorities banned the wearing of face masks, and at a demonstration on 1 October, the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People’s Republic of China, police fired live ammunition at protesters for the first time. After initially proposing postponements and amendments to legislation, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam eventually announced that she would withdraw the bill. This was done on 23 October, but protesters’ demands had broadened to include implementation of genuine universal suffrage and release of arrested protestors, and unrest continued into 2020.","Shutter Speed

This escalated into calls to oust the administration and for an overhaul of the political system imposed by the US in 2003 after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Protesters claimed that a small elite were able to keep a grip on political power through a quota system based on sectarian and ethnic identity. Iran was also targeted for its close links with Iraq’s elite and what was seen as its complicity in the administration’s failures. Government forces acted with exceptional severity, firing live rounds and, according to eyewitness reports given to Amnesty International, shooting tear-gas canisters and smoke grenades directly at protesters. A statement released by the UN on 29 November said that at least 354 people had been killed and 8,104 injured since the protests began.

Many women played an important role in IS recruitment via social media and jihadist forums. ‘The Annex’ housed women of foreign origin. Western countries generally hesitated to repatriate former IS members, citing security risks, although some did accept orphaned children. As the campaign against IS grew more successful, al-Hol, which was controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), overfilled and conditions grew squalid, with hundreds of people, particularly children, dying of disease and malnutrition. In early October, US president Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of US troops from the Syrian-Turkish border area, where they had been supporting the SDF, ahead of a Turkish military incursion into the area. The SDF suspended counter-IS operations to focus on the Turkish incursion. Unrest broke out at al-Hol and there were reports of escapes, as people sensed SDF control over the camp was weakening.","Shutter Speed

                                Protests in Sudan began in December 2018 and spread rapidly throughout the country. By April 2019, protesters were staging a sit-in close to army headquarters in the capital Khartoum, and demanding an end to the 30-year rule of dictator Omar al-Bashir. On 11 April, al-Bashir was removed from office in a military coup, and a transitional military government was established. Protests continued, calling for power to be handed to civilian groups. On 3 June, government forces opened fire on unarmed protesters. Scores of people were killed and many more subject to further violence. Three days later the African Union suspended Sudan, in the midst of widespread international condemnation of the attack. The authorities sought to defuse protests by imposing blackouts, and shutting down the internet. Protesters communicated by text message, word of mouth and using megaphones, and resistance to military rule continued. Despite another severe crackdown on 30 June, the pro-democracy movement was eventually successful in signing a power-sharing agreement with the military, on 17 August.","Shutter Speed

                                The Arctic permafrost is thawing at a faster rate than climatologists predicted, releasing carbon gases that could speed up global heating. Permafrost is carbon-rich frozen soil that covers 24% of the Northern Hemisphere land mass, encompassing vast stretches of territory across Alaska, Canada, Siberia and Greenland. It is a combination of soil, rocks and sand held together by ice and containing large amounts of organic carbon—frozen plant material that doesn’t decompose. As permafrost thaws, this material rots, releasing carbon dioxide and shorter-lived methane. Methane can be between 25 and 86 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, depending on the timeframe of measurement. The thaw impacts people living in the region—particularly indigenous communities following centuries-old lifestyles. Thawing permafrost undermines house foundations, makes the landscape more difficult to navigate and causes ice cellars (homemade freezers dug into the permafrost) to flood and provisions to spoil.","Shutter Speed

                                Lake Urmia, in northwest Iran, once one of the largest salt lakes in the world, is drying up. In the 1990s, it was twice the size of Luxembourg, but intensified droughts and elevated summer temperatures have sped up evaporation. In addition, illegal wells together with a proliferation of dams and irrigation projects along the lake’s tributaries have diverted water to farm fields. Research by an international group of scientists conducted in 2014 showed that the lake had shrunk to about 12% of its size in the 1970s. In addition, environmentalists argue that a 15-kilometer-long causeway that cuts the lake in two, built in 2008, contributes to the drying as it inhibits water flow between the two sides. The exposed lakebed forms a vast salt desert that cannot support agriculture and is susceptible to salt storms which adversely affect surrounding agriculture, and cause eye, skin and lung disorders. Residents in the area, for whom the lake was once a leisure spot, are moving away. The desiccation also affects food sources for migratory birds such as flamingos, ducks and egrets. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has pledged US$5 billion over ten years to revive Urmia, and the United Nations Development Programme is working with farmers to introduce more sustainable working practices.","Shutter Speed

                                Amager Bakke, a waste-to-energy plant that replaced an old coal incineration plant, near Copenhagen, Denmark, produces enough electricity to power at least 60,000 homes and heat 72,000.

                                For centuries, industrialized countries have followed a take-make-waste linear economy: raw materials are gathered and transformed into products that are sold and then discarded as waste. Value is created in this economic system by producing and selling as many products as possible. The model not only drains natural resources, but also—in the demands it makes in energy consumption and because of a reliance on fossil fuels—exacerbates global heating. A circular economy offers an alternative by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is based on designing waste and pollution out of the system, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. Farmers, manufacturers and governments across the globe are taking steps to experiment with and implement a circular economy as part of their efforts to address the climate crisis","Shutter Speed

                                Lake Victoria, nearly 60,000 square kilometers in area, harbours immense natural resources but is threatened by industrial, waste-water and agricultural pollution, over-harvesting of resources, land clearance around the banks, and decreased rainfall due to global heating. This impacts both biodiversity and the livelihoods of more than 30 million people in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Fishing alone economically supports more than 3 million people, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, yet 70% of fish endemic to the lake are threatened with extinction. Small-scale fishing is illegal because the equipment used catches immature fish before they can breed, but poorer fishers cannot afford the necessary nets nor the larger boats that can take them beyond the worst pollution around the shoreline.","Shutter Speed

                                The Marsh Complex Fire began near Marsh Creek Road in Contra Costa County on 3 August and burned until 7 August, laying waste to more than 300 hectares of land. Roughly 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) burned statewide in California in 2019, compared with 765,000 in 2018, and 525,000 in 2017. California usually has a fire season in the fall, when strong winds blow across forests and brushland that has dried out from summer heat and not yet experienced winter rains. Many scientists attributed the early fires to the climate crisis, saying that a warmer atmosphere means that the vegetation is drying out more than it did a century ago. Old, faulty equipment belonging to the state’s largest power companies has also been blamed for sparking fires in windy weather. President Donald Trump accused the Californian state government of bad forest management, saying that was the cause of the fires.","Shutter Speed

                                The Arctic harbors some of the fastest-retreating sea ice on the planet and has twice the average global heating rate. This will strongly affect the global climate in terms of increasing temperatures and sea-level rise, yet Arctic climate system processes are poorly represented in climate models. This is because until now scientific missions have not been able to penetrate the region during the six-month long night of the Arctic winter. The Polarstern is the central ship of an expedition run by the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), especially designed to withstand extremely low temperatures and break through thicker ice, enabling around 100 researchers and crew to work all year round. MOSAiC data on the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ecosystem and biogeochemistry will be fed into global climate models.","Shutter Speed

                                A political and socio-economic crisis in Venezuela, from 2016 onwards, led to an increasing outflow of migrants from the country. Venezuelans said they were compelled to leave for reasons of insecurity and violence, lack of access to food, medicine and essential services, and loss of income due to the political situation. Colombia feels the impact of this exodus most keenly. According to the UNHCR, by October 2019 approximately 4.5 million Venezuelans had left the country, of which 1.6 million were in Colombia. Others had moved through Colombia before going on to surrounding countries. Even though Venezuela officially closed its land border with Colombia in February, around 300 clandestine crossing points remained active. More than half of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia lacked regular status, and so had no access to health, education or legal employment. Charity organizations and NGOs helped supply people with medical attention and food, but many ended up in informal settlements or living on the streets.

Early in 2021, the Colombian government granted the refugees a ten-year temporary protection status, giving them access to the national health service, the job market, and other forms of assistance. The story contributed to some NGOs setting up educational and medical facilities in camps they had previously not known about. The photographer said: “Photographs can drive actions, and I photograph with that intention.”","Shutter Speed

                                Between 5,000 and 10,000 tigers live in captivity in the US. Roadside zoos and other businesses breed tigers and charge guests to pet and pose with them. Individuals also keep tigers as pets. By contrast, there are only 3,900 wild tigers in Asia and 1,659 in accredited zoos worldwide. Many of America’s exotic pets are not covered by the 1973 Endangered Species Act, which applies only to those taken from the wild, not those bred in captivity. Four US states have no laws on keeping big cats as pets, and in ten others, although a permit is required, once secured for a small pet it can be used to acquire a larger animal such as a tiger. By the time cubs bought as pets are four months old they become too large and dangerous to keep domestically, and are sold on, opening concerns that this feeds the highly lucrative illegal international trade in tiger parts. Investigations by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is tasked with enforcing the Animal Welfare Act, dropped by 92% between 2016 and 2018. In June, the US House of Representatives reprimanded the USDA for redirecting its focus from active enforcement to providing “teachable moment” interactions with the public. A federal Big Cat Public Safety Act has now been proposed. It will address the gap in state laws and prohibit the private ownership of big cats, and ensure that if they cannot be returned to the wild, they can be transferred to accredited sanctuaries.","Shutter Speed

                                The Taliban made significant territorial gains and increased their influence in Afghanistan in 2019. Eighteen years after the US invasion, and five years since the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have been responsible for securing Afghanistan, the Taliban control or contest around half the country, in some districts acting as a shadow government. Peace talks begun in January appeared to be nearing agreement in August, but were scuppered by US president Donald Trump in September. Fighting escalated during talks as both sides tried to gain leverage, while on the ground the talks provided the Taliban with increasing political legitimacy. The frequency and spread of Taliban violence left the ANDSF overstretched and in some cases overwhelmed, with a high casualty rate. The escalation of the conflict also severely impacted the civilian population, resulting in high casualties, forced displacement, extreme insecurity, lack of access to education and a weakened public health system. A report published in June 2019 by the Institute for Peace and Economics named Afghanistan as the world’s “least peaceful” country, replacing Syria, though by early 2020 it seemed that a peace agreement was once again a possibility.","Shutter Speed

The study points to the rise in internet and social media use by far-right groups, connections between local and international groups, and political developments in the US as major contributing factors. Although the rise began before Donald Trump began campaigning for the US presidency, the study suggests that individuals have been energized by his election. In September, US Homeland Security named white supremacy a leading terrorist threat.

                                During October and November, thousands of Central American migrants joined a caravan heading to the United States border. The caravan, assembled through a grassroots social media campaign, left San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on 12 October, and as word spread drew people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. They were a mix of those facing political repression and violence, and those fleeing harsh economic conditions in the hope of a better life. Traveling in a caravan offered a degree of safety on a route where migrants have previously disappeared or been kidnapped, and was an alternative to paying high rates to people smugglers. Migrant caravans travel to the US border at different times each year, but this was the largest in recent memory with as many as 7,000 travelers, including at least 2,300 children, according to UN agencies. Conditions along the way were grueling, with people walking around 30 km a day, often in temperatures above 30°C. The caravan usually set off at around 4am each day to avoid the heat. Like others, the caravan drew condemnation from US president Donald Trump, who made it a focal point of rallies and used it to reiterate his call for tough immigration policies and the building of a border wall.","Shutter Speed

                                After nearly four years of conflict in Yemen, at least 8.4 million people are at risk of starvation and 22 million people—75% of the population—are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. In 2014, Houthi Shia Muslim rebels seized northern areas of the country, forcing the president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, into exile. The conflict spread, and escalated when Saudi Arabia, in coalition with eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, began air strikes against the Houthis. By 2018, the war had led to what the UN termed the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster. Saudi Arabia said that Iran—a Shia-majority state and their rival regional power—was backing the Houthis with weapons and supplies, a charge Iran denied. The Saudi-led coalition implemented a blockade on Yemen, imposing import restrictions on food, medicines and fuel. Resulting shortages exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. In many cases, conditions of near-famine were caused not so much by the unavailability of food, but because it became unaffordable, priced out of reach to most Yemenis by import restrictions, soaring transport costs due to fuel scarcity, a collapsing currency and other man-made supply disruptions.","Shutter Speed

                                A humanitarian crisis is underway in the Chad Basin, caused by a complex combination of political conflict and environmental factors. Lake Chad—once one of Africa’s largest lakes and a lifeline to 40 million people—is experiencing massive desertification. As a result of unplanned irrigation, extended drought, deforestation and resource mismanagement, the size of the lake has decreased by 90 percent over the past 60 years. Traditional livelihoods such as fishing have withered, and water shortages are causing conflict between farmers and cattle herders. Jihadist group Boko Haram, which is active in the area, both benefits from the hardship and widespread hunger and contributes to it. The group uses local villages as a recruiting ground, and the protracted conflict has uprooted 2.5 million people, exacerbating food insecurity.

Pregnancy was thought incompatible with guerrilla life. Women were obliged to put war before children, leaving babies with relatives or, some say, undergoing forced abortions—a charge FARC denies.","Shutter Speed

During the final offensive, Eastern Ghouta came under rocket fire and air bombardment, including at least one alleged gas attack—on the village of al-Shifunieh, on 25 February. Figures are difficult to verify, but Médecins Sans Frontiѐres (MSF) reported 4,829 wounded and 1,005 killed between 18 February and 3 March, according to data from medical facilities they supported alone. MSF also reported 13 hospitals and clinics damaged or destroyed in just three days. Reports on the end of the siege in Eastern Ghouta are conflicting, though the Syrian army appear to have recaptured most of the south of the country by July. UNICEF reported the siege of Eastern Ghouta to have ended by late March, with limited humanitarian access becoming available.","Shutter Speed

Akashinga (‘The Brave Ones’) is a ranger force established as an alternative conservation model. It aims to work with, rather than against local populations, for the long-term benefits of their communities and the environment. Akashinga comprises women from disadvantaged backgrounds, empowering them, offering jobs, and helping local people to benefit directly from the preservation of wildlife. Other strategies—such as using fees from trophy hunting to fund conservation—have been criticized for imposing solutions from the outside and excluding the needs of local people.","Shutter Speed

                                An ambulance packed with explosives killed 103 people and injured 235 in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 27 January. The ambulance had passed through one security point unnoticed, but although the attacker was identified at a second checkpoint, he couldn’t be stopped from detonating his explosives. The bombing took place at lunchtime near Chicken Street, a central shopping area once popular among foreign nationals, and close to government and diplomatic buildings. The victims, however, were overwhelmingly Afghan civilians and police. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the ambulance bombing, which ranked among the worst civilian attacks in the Afghan capital in some years. Taliban commanders said they were intensifying urban attacks in retaliation for increased airstrikes on areas under their control.","Shutter Speed

During the final offensive, Eastern Ghouta came under rocket fire and air bombardment, including at least one alleged gas attack—on the village of al-Shifunieh, on 25 February. Figures are difficult to verify, but Médecins Sans Frontiѐres (MSF) reported 4,829 wounded and 1,005 killed between 18 February and 3 March, according to data from medical facilities they supported alone. MSF also reported 13 hospitals and clinics damaged or destroyed in just three days. Reports on the end of the siege in Eastern Ghouta are conflicting, though the Syrian army appear to have recaptured most of the south of the country by July. UNICEF reported the siege of Eastern Ghouta to have ended by late March, with limited humanitarian access becoming available.","Shutter Speed

                                During October and November, thousands of Central American migrants joined a caravan heading to the United States border. The caravan, assembled through a grassroots social media campaign, left San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on 12 October, and as word spread drew people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. They were a mix of those facing political repression and violence, and those fleeing harsh economic conditions in the hope of a better life. Traveling in a caravan offered a degree of safety on a route where migrants have previously disappeared or been kidnapped, and was an alternative to paying high rates to people smugglers. Migrant caravans travel to the US border at different times each year, but this was the largest in recent memory with as many as 7,000 travelers, including at least 2,300 children, according to UN agencies. Conditions along the way were grueling, with people walking around 30 km a day, often in temperatures above 30°C. The caravan usually set off at around 4am each day to avoid the heat. Like others, the caravan drew condemnation from US president Donald Trump, who made it a focal point of rallies and used it to reiterate his call for tough immigration policies and the building of a border wall.",,"Focal length

President Rodrigo Duterte began a concerted anti-drug offensive soon after taking office in June 2016, repeatedly ordering increased attacks against suspects. Amnesty International reports that this led to human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings by both civilians and police. A spokesman for the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency said the campaign had led to 5,050 deaths by December 2018, with Human Rights Watch citing over 12,000. In June, 38 UN member states called on President Duterte to end the killings and probe the causes of the drug war.","Shutter Speed

Immigrant families had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were then detained by US authorities. Sandra Sanchez said that she and her daughter had been traveling for a month through Central America and Mexico before reaching the US to seek asylum. The Trump Administration had announced a ‘zero tolerance’ policy at the border under which immigrants caught entering the US could be criminally prosecuted. As a result, many apprehended parents were separated from their children, often sent to different detention facilities. After this picture was published worldwide, US Customs and Border Protection confirmed that Yanela and her mother had not been among the thousands who had been separated by US officials. Nevertheless, public outcry over the controversial practice resulted in President Donald Trump reversing the policy on 20 June.

The photographer says: “As a photojournalist, my job is to inform and report what is happening, but I also think it is important to humanize an issue that is often reported in statistics.”","Shutter Speed

As football is the nation’s most popular sport, the ban has been a controversial public issue. On 1 March 2018, FIFA president Gianni Infantino met with the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, to address the issue. Social-media groups also put the president under pressure, and on 20 June a ruling allowed Tehran’s Azadi Stadium to admit selected groups of women for international matches.The concession to women fans applied only to international matches, and after a senior judicial officer objected in October, it was withdrawn. On 10 November, the FIFA president, who was attending the AFC Cup match in Tehran, asked to be shown that women were being allowed to attend. A selection of women was permitted to enter, though many others were barred.","Shutter Speed

                                Women and girls wear fallera dresses for the Fallas de Valencia festival in Valencia, Spain. Inspired by clothes worn centuries ago by women working in rice fields around the city, the dresses have changed over time and are now elaborate creations that can cost in excess of €1,000. Made mainly of lace and silk, fallera dresses are worn by anyone who wants to take part in what is one of Spain’s biggest street festivals. To complement the gown, falleras set their hair in a traditional three-bun style adorned with ornate combs and jewellery, often handed down through generations. Different parts of the city each have a fallera mayor (and maybe also a young fallera mayor infantil)—a woman who represents her falla (neighborhood group) at the festivities. It is an honor to be chosen, and can mean even greater expense being lavished on the outfit.",,,,,,2019 Photo Contest, 3rd Prize, Portraits, Stories,{'falleras'},{'Twins Claudia'},1.0,1.0,"{'Spain', 'Victoria', 'Valencia'}",3.0

                                Nigeria has one of the highest occurrences of twins in the world, particularly among the Yoruba people in the southwest. In the southwestern town of Igbo-Ora, dubbed ‘The Nation’s Home of Twins’, reportedly almost every family has at least one set. In 2018, the town hosted a Twins Festival, attended by over 2,000 pairs. The first-born twin is usually called Taiwo, meaning ‘having the first taste of the world’, while the second-born is named Kehinde, ‘arriving after the other’. Communities have developed different cultural practices in response to this high birth rate, from veneration to demonization. In earlier times, twins in some regions were considered evil, and vilified or killed at birth. Nowadays, the arrival of twins is generally met with celebration, and many think they bring good luck and wealth. Two color filters were used, to express duality: of identity, of photographers, and of attitude to twins.","Shutter Speed

Prostitution between consenting adults is legal in Germany, and German aid charities have reported a marked increase in the number of young migrants turning to sex work. While they wait for their documents, refugees are not allowed to work legally or attend school. The German government prioritizes assistance to refugees from countries with an ongoing war; those seeking asylum from countries without war are placed in a second category, where papers take longer to complete. This lack of employment opportunity creates a severe lack of choice for many, with some young men becoming sex workers, sometimes to fund a heroin addiction. The Tiergarten, a large park in central Berlin, is a popular meeting spot for male sex workers and older clients. Mohamed now works in a gay bar, and is quitting heroin. He is not gay, and Jochen knows that, but being with Jochen was one of the less harmful options he had in life.","Shutter Speed

They can survive in a variety of habitats, from deserts and prairies to forests and snowy mountains, but are generally shy and elusive to humans. The Torres del Paine region in Chilean Patagonia is thought to contain higher concentrations of pumas than anywhere else in the world. Pumas are ambush predators, stalking their prey from a distance for an hour or more before attacking. In Torres del Paine, pumas feed mainly on guanacos, which are closely related to llamas.","Shutter Speed

                                The millennia-old practice of falconry is experiencing an international resurgence, especially as a result of efforts in the Arab world. UNESCO now recognises falconry as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (ICH), a status enjoyed by no other hunting sport. Falcons bred in captivity have helped diminish the trade in captured wild birds, including some species that are listed as endangered. But some falcons in the wild continue to be at risk from capture and other anthropogenic factors such as electrocution on badly designed powerlines, habitat degradation and agrochemicals. Similarly, although the breeding of birds such as houbara bustards for prey has made hunting a more sustainable practice, the British Ornithologists’ Union reported that the wild houbara population continued to decline.","Shutter Speed

                                31 March 2013 - 19 March 2018
Under Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013, the country experienced the biggest economic boom in its history. Venezuela has the highest proven oil reserves in the world, and Chávez took office as oil prices soared in the 2000s. Chavez used these revenues to nationalise key industries and expand social programs as part of his plan for a more equal, prosperous and secure nation. However, by the end of Chavez’s presidency his government’s policies were unsustainable, leading to a faltering economy, increases in Venezuela’s homicide rate, and on-going corruption within the government.



His successor, Nicolás Maduro, has overseen a country in spectacular decline. Oil prices crashed in 2014, and Maduro’s attempts to continue welfare programs led to government over-expenditure and ultimately hyperinflation, a situation compounded by US sanctions. Political tensions have escalated with increasing shortages of food, medicine and other essential items. Protests are widespread, and according to the Venezuelan NGO Observatorio de Violencia, the predicted rate of 81.4 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018 makes Venezuela the most violent country in Latin America.



The photographer picks up the story in 2013, starting with Chavez’s death, and aims to tell the story of a crumbling country from the inside.","Shutter Speed

Across Mexico, more than 37,400 people have been categorized as ‘missing’ by official sources. The vast majority of those are believed to be dead—victims of ongoing violence that has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006. These disappearances are the source of lasting psychological trauma for families left behind.

The violence has its roots in the war on Mexico’s powerful drugs cartels instigated by President Felipe Calderón during his 2006–2012 term of office, and continued by his successor, Enrique Peña Nieto. The ensuing violence has led to a catastrophic rise in murder rates and in the number of unsolved disappearances, which is aided by corruption and impunity. President Nieto promised an end to violence, but although homicides declined, authorities seemed unable to restore the rule of law or make much progress in the struggle against cartels. Among the states most affected are Sinaloa and Guerrero, which was included in a list of no-travel zones by the US government in 2018. 

In 2013, one of the photographer’s brothers-in-law was killed and another two disappeared. This led him to begin documenting the resultant psychological and emotional fracture in his own family and in the families of other missing people, to give a personal account of the despair and sense of absence that accrues over time.","Shutter Speed

Patriotic education, often with a military subtext, forms the mainspring of many youth programs in both Russia and the United States. In America, the dual messages of ‘America first’ and ‘Americanism’ can be found not only as a driving force behind adult political movements, but around the country in camps and clubs where young people are taught what it means to be an American. In Russia, patriotic clubs and camps are encouraged by government. In 2015, President Vladimir Putin ordered the creation of a Russian students’ movement whose aim was to help form the characters of young people through instruction in ideology, religion and preparedness for war. The ‘Patriotic Education of Russian Citizens in 2016–2020’ program called for an 8 percent increase in patriotism among youth, and a 10 percent increase in recruits to the armed forces. 

The photographer visited ten youth programs in the US, as well as schools and military summer camps in Russia. The aim of the series is to use these young people and their lives as the focal point in an open dialogue around the ideas instilled in future generations, and examine how young people are responding to contemporary society.",,,,,,2019 Photo Contest, 1st Prize, Long-Term Projects, Stories,{'Vladimir Putin'},{'The ‘Patriotic Education of'},1.0,1.0,"{'Dmitrov', 'America', 'US', 'the United States', 'Russia'}",5.0

                                Beni, in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has been affected by conflict for over 25 years, and in 2018 had also to deal with a major outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. Over 100 armed groups are estimated to be active in the region, with government troops backed by MONUSCO, a UN stabilization mission, battling with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and other rebel groups. Attacks in and around the town spiked during the Ebola epidemic, which Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) called the second-largest recorded anywhere.The Ebola outbreak was first declared on 1 August, in the small town of Mangina, 30 km from Beni, and soon spread. By the end of the year, some 700 cases and over 460 deaths had been reported. Containing the highly contagious disease was almost impossible in a conflict situation. Widespread displacement made containing and tracking cases complicated and meant some stricken areas were difficult to access. Medical teams’ operations were disrupted, and misinformation about the disease was rife.","Shutter Speed

The run-up was marked by protests, street rallies and clashes between opposition supporters and police. Elections had been repeatedly postponed since President Kabila’s mandate expired in 2016. The election was won by Felix Tshisekedi, leader of DRC’s largest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS).

                                After nearly four years of conflict in Yemen, at least 8.4 million people are at risk of starvation and 22 million people—75% of the population—are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. In 2014, Houthi Shia Muslim rebels seized northern areas of the country, forcing the president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, into exile. The conflict spread, and escalated when Saudi Arabia, in coalition with eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, began air strikes against the Houthis. By 2018, the war had led to what the UN termed the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster. Saudi Arabia said that Iran—a Shia-majority state and their rival regional power—was backing the Houthis with weapons and supplies, a charge Iran denied. The Saudi-led coalition implemented a blockade on Yemen, imposing import restrictions on food, medicines and fuel. Resulting shortages exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. In many cases, conditions of near-famine were caused not so much by the unavailability of food, but because it became unaffordable, priced out of reach to most Yemenis by import restrictions, soaring transport costs due to fuel scarcity, a collapsing currency and other man-made supply disruptions.","Shutter Speed

President Macron’s three-day visit to the United States was the first official state visit of the Trump administration. Unexpectedly, the two presidents’ body language went beyond the norm for such visits, bordering on the intimate. The leaders also praised each other effusively. The 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran was one of the main topics under discussion. Macron aimed to persuade Trump to adhere to the deal, which limited Iran’s nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions, but failed. On 8 May, President Trump withdrew from the agreement, breaking with European allies. The relationship between the two leaders appears to have soured, with Trump later attacking Macron on Twitter.","Shutter Speed

Fuego, around 40 km southwest of the capital Guatemala City, is one of Latin America’s most active volcanoes, and has been erupting periodically since 2002.

Guano, the nitrate-rich droppings of birds such as pelicans, boobies and cormorants, became popular as a fertilizer in the 19th century, and Peru’s Guano Islands were a prime source. The boom ended with the introduction of ammonia-based chemical fertilizers in the early 20th century, but the bird populations had nosedived. Today, guano mining is much less frequent, rotates location, and is supervised by conservationists, allowing some of Peru’s seabird populations to recover. The archive photographs were taken by the marine biologist Robert E. Coker, who began working in Peru in 1906.","Shutter Speed

Environmental groups and honey producers say that the introduction of genetically modified soy and use of the agrochemical glyphosate endangers health, contaminates crops, and reduces the market value of honey by threatening its ‘organic’ label. Soy production also leads to deforestation, as land is increasingly bought for farming, further affecting bee populations.","Shutter Speed

                                A humanitarian crisis is underway in the Chad Basin, caused by a complex combination of political conflict and environmental factors. Lake Chad—once one of Africa’s largest lakes and a lifeline to 40 million people—is experiencing massive desertification. As a result of unplanned irrigation, extended drought, deforestation and resource mismanagement, the size of the lake has decreased by 90 percent over the past 60 years. Traditional livelihoods such as fishing have withered, and water shortages are causing conflict between farmers and cattle herders. Jihadist group Boko Haram, which is active in the area, both benefits from the hardship and widespread hunger and contributes to it. The group uses local villages as a recruiting ground, and the protracted conflict has uprooted 2.5 million people, exacerbating food insecurity.","Shutter Speed

floating on the Pasig River, in Manila, Philippines.



The Pasig River was declared biologically dead in the 1990s, due to a combination

of industrial pollution and waste being dumped by nearby communities living without adequate sanitation infrastructure. A 2017 report by Nature Communications cites the Pasig as one of 20 most polluted rivers in the world, with up to 63,700 tons of plastic deposited into the ocean each year. Efforts are being made to clean up the Pasig, which were recognized by an international prize in 2018, but in parts of the river the waste is still so dense that it is possible to walk on top of the garbage.","Shutter Speed

Akashinga (‘The Brave Ones’) is a ranger force established as an alternative conservation model. It aims to work with, rather than against local populations, for the long-term benefits of their communities and the environment. Akashinga comprises women from disadvantaged backgrounds, empowering them, offering jobs, and helping local people to benefit directly from the preservation of wildlife. Other strategies—such as using fees from trophy hunting to fund conservation—have been criticized for imposing solutions from the outside and excluding the needs of local people.","Shutter Speed

President Donald Trump has declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency. The crisis has its roots in the 1990s, when pharmaceutical companies assured doctors that opioid pain relievers were not addictive. The firm Purdue Pharma, in particular, has been accused of aggressive marketing even when the effects of opioids were known. Increased prescription of opioids such as Oxycontin led to widespread misuse. Some people switched to heroin, which was cheaper, and later to synthetic opioids, which are more potent and more likely to lead to a fatal overdose.","Shutter Speed

                                On 25 May, Ireland voted by a large majority to overturn its abortion laws, which were among the most restrictive in the world. A 1983 referendum had resulted in an Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution reinforcing a ban on terminations, even those resulting from rape and incest. Prior to the referendum, an estimated 3,000 women traveled to the UK annually for abortions. In 2012, the death of Savita Halappanavar from sepsis after doctors had denied her a termination, shocked Ireland and galvanized campaigners calling for an end to the ban. Her name became synonymous with the movement to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The campaign broadened, arguing that restrictions on women impact everyone in society, and that the support of men, too, was necessary to effect change. Campaigners used social media platforms to spread their message, and took the argument to the streets in the form of demonstrations and theatrical spectacle. Nearly two thirds of the Irish population turned out to participate in the referendum, with 66.4 percent voting to overturn the abortion prohibition. By the end of the year, the Irish president had signed a new bill into law, making abortion for any pregnancy less than 12 weeks available without cost.",,,,,,2019 Photo Contest, 1st Prize, Contemporary Issues, Stories,"{'Shirani Bolle', 'Graffiti'}",{'Savita Halappanavar'},2.0,1.0,"{'UK', 'Ireland', 'Dublin'}",3.0

UNHCR reports that Iran has almost one million registered refugees, the vast majority from Afghanistan. In addition, more than 1.5 million undocumented Afghans are estimated to be present in the country. Many people fleeing violence, insecurity and poverty in Afghanistan find no alternative but to use illegal traffickers, along routes where they are exposed to robbery, kidnapping and death. Their aim is to pass through Iran and Turkey or Greece to seek a better life elsewhere, but trafficked refugees are highly vulnerable to forced labor, debt bondage, forced marriage, or work in the sex trade.","Shutter Speed

During a boot camp, Ethan and fellow recruits were ordered to walk naked through a communal shower while pressed together. Ethan reported the incident, but was harassed by the other men for doing so. Nightmares and panic attacks later forced him to resign. Recent Defense Department figures show sexual assault in the military to be on the increase.

A girl’s quinceañera (fifteenth birthday) is a Latino coming-of-age tradition marking transition into womanhood. It is a gender specific rite of passage, traditionally showcasing a girl’s purity and readiness for marriage. Families go to great expense, often celebrating with a lavish party. The girl dresses as a princess, living out a fantasy and perceived idea of femininity. In Cuba, the tradition has transformed into a performance involving photo and video shoots, often documented in a photobook. Pura’s quinceañera had a special poignancy, as some years earlier, having been diagnosed with a brain tumor, she was told she would not live beyond the age of 13.",,,,,,2019 Photo Contest, 1st Prize, Contemporary Issues, Singles,{'Pura'},set(),1.0,0.0,"{'Havana', 'Latino', 'Cuba'}",3.0

The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim minority group in Rakhine State, western Myanmar. They number around one million people, but laws passed in the 1980s effectively deprived them of Myanmar citizenship. Violence erupted in Myanmar on 25 August after a faction of Rohingya militants attacked police posts, killing 12 members of the Myanmar security forces. Myanmar authorities, in places supported by groups of Buddhists, launched a crackdown, attacking Rohingya villages and burning houses. According to the UNHCR, the number of Rohingya that subsequently fled Myanmar for Bangladesh reached 500,000 on 28 September.","Shutter Speed

President Maduro had announced plans to revise Venezuela’s democratic system by forming a constituent assembly to replace the opposition-led National Assembly, in effect consolidating legislative powers for himself. Opposition leaders called for mass protests to demand early presidential elections. Clashes between protesters and the Venezuelan national guard broke out on 3 May, with protesters (many of whom wore hoods, masks or gas masks) lighting fires and hurling stones. Salazar was set alight when the gas tank of a motorbike exploded. He survived the incident with first- and second-degree burns.","Shutter Speed

Violent clashes had broken out between demonstrators and the national guard. The motorcycle, belonging to a member of the national guard, was apparently being destroyed by protesters. Accounts of the incident differ, but some say that an object thrown by protesters caused the gas tank to explode. Further reports maintain that Salazar’s clothing caught fire so readily because he was doused in petrol either by a bomb he was carrying, or that of a fellow protestor. Salazar suffered severe burns to more than 70% of his body, but survived the incident.",,,,,,2018 Photo Contest, 3rd prize, Spot News, Stories,{'Nicolás Maduro'},{'Salazar'},1.0,1.0,"{'Caracas', 'Venezuela'}",2.0

Three people were killed instantly, and two more died in the days after the attack; at least 40 were injured. Armed with two knives, Masood left the car and attempted to enter the grounds of parliament, where he fatally stabbed one of the policemen who tried to stop him, before being shot and killed. Born Adrian Russell Elms in Kent, UK, Masood changed his name when he converted to Islam. Although ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack the following day, police investigating found no evidence of any links between Masood and either ISIS or al-Qaeda.","Shutter Speed

The minimum age that boys may participate in a proper corrida, with a live bull, is 16. In February 2018, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child urged Spain to ban children from attending bull fights or bullfighting schools. Proponents say that bullfighting is part of Spain’s national fabric, an art form that encourages striving for the best.","Shutter Speed

The game is played between hundreds of participants in two eight-hour periods on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday (the day preceding and the day marking the start of Christian Lent). The two teams are determined by which side of the River Henmore players are born: Up’ards are from north of the river; Down’ards, south. Players score goals by tapping the ball three times on millstones set into pillars three miles apart.
There are very few rules apart from an historic stipulation that players may not murder their opponents, and the more contemporary requirement that the ball must not be transported in bags, rucksacks, or motorized vehicles. Royal Shrovetide Football is believed to have been played in Ashbourne since the 17th century.","Shutter Speed

Prostitution is illegal in Russia, and though fines are not large (about €28) women are vulnerable to extortion because they fear the consequences of having a criminal record. According to Silver Rose, despite the stereotypical view of sex workers, only a small percentage have taken to prostitution because they are addicts or living in extreme poverty. The decline of the Russian economy has led to a growing number of women—many over the age of 35—who have lost jobs in such fields as business or education becoming sex workers.","Shutter Speed

The girls were strapped with explosives, and ordered to blow themselves up in crowded areas, but managed to escape and find help instead of detonating the bombs. Boko Haram—a Nigeria-based militant Islamist group whose name translates roughly to ‘Western education is forbidden’—expressly targets schools and has abducted more than 2,000 women and girls since 2014. Female suicide bombers are seen by the militants as a new weapon of war. In 2016, The New York Times reported at least one in every five suicide bombers deployed by Boko Haram over the previous two years had been a child, usually a girl. The group used 27 children in suicide attacks in the first quarter of 2017, compared to nine during the same period the previous year.","Shutter Speed

Djeneta and Ibadeta are Roma refugees, from Kosovo. Resignation syndrome (RS) renders patients passive, immobile, mute, unable to eat and drink, incontinent and unresponsive to physical stimulus. It is a condition believed to exist only amongst refugees in Sweden. The causes are unclear, but most professionals agree that trauma is a primary contributor, alongside a reaction to stress and depression. It is also not clear why cases are found exclusively in Sweden. RS has so far affected only refugees aged seven to 19, and mainly those from ex-Soviet countries or the former Yugoslavia. For many, the syndrome is triggered by having a residence application rejected. Granting residence to families of sufferers is often cited as a cure.","Shutter Speed

                                Four major ocean currents converge along the Galapagos archipelago, creating the conditions for an extraordinary diversity of animal life. The islands are home to at least 7,000 flora and fauna species, of which 97 percent of the reptiles, 80 percent of the land birds, 50 percent of the insects and 30 percent of the plants are endemic. The local ecosystem is highly sensitive to the changes in temperature, rainfall and ocean currents that characterize the climatic events known as El Niño and La Niña. These changes cause marked fluctuations in weather and food availability. Many scientists expect the frequency of El Niño and La Niña to increase as a result of climate change, making the Galapagos a possible early-warning location for its effects.","Shutter Speed

As the range of the macaque habitat expands from mountain areas to subalpine and lowland regions, the animals have lost their fear, have taken to raiding crops, and are often seen as pests. Despite macaques being officially protected in Japan since 1947, some local laws allow them to be tamed and trained for the entertainment industry. Once considered sacred mediators between gods and humans, monkeys in Japan also came to be seen as representing dislikable humans, deserving of ridicule. Commercial entertainment involving monkeys has existed in Japan for over 1,000 years.","Shutter Speed

The Reteti sanctuary is part of the Namunyak Wildlife Conservation Trust, located in the ancestral homeland of the Samburu people. The elephant orphanage was established in 2016 by local Samburus, and all the men working there are, or were at some time, Samburu warriors. In the past, local people weren’t much interested in saving elephants, which can be a threat to humans and their property, but now they are beginning to relate to the animals in a new way. Elephants feed on low brush and knock down small trees, promoting the growth of grasses—of advantage to the pastoralist Samburu.","Shutter Speed

Among the most numerous of penguins, rockhoppers are nevertheless considered vulnerable, and their population is declining, probably as the result of a decreasing food supply. The birds spend five to six months at sea, coming to shore only to molt and breed. They are often found bounding, rather than waddling as other penguins do, and are capable of diving to depths of up to 100 meters in pursuit of fish, crustaceans, squid and krill.","Shutter Speed

                                After years of experiencing social chaos, drugs trafficking and political corruption, many Latin Americans are determined to resist the violence afflicting their homelands. Armed conflict and socio-economic collapse in a number of Latin American countries in the latter part of the 20th century forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of people, both to neighboring states and northwards to the US. Stricter US policies in the mid-1990s led to the deportation of members of maras, Hispanic gangs formed on the streets of cities such as Los Angeles, and fueled gang warfare across Latin America. This, and violence associated with both the drugs trade and the so-called War on Drugs, has led to a number of Latin American cities ranking with the most violent in the world outside of a conflict zone. This project describes the fear, anger and impotence of victims amidst the daily terror of street gangs, murder and thievery in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Colombia. The photographer wanted to document the heart of uncontrolled violence in Latin America, and the social and political factors that aggressively reinforce that violence, as well as the determination to end it.","Shutter Speed

                                Ethiopia is in the midst of an economic boom, with growth averaging 10.5 percent a year—double the regional average. One of the areas most impacted by this is the Omo Valley, an area of extraordinary biodiversity along the course of the Omo River, which rises in the central Shewan highlands and empties into Lake Turkana, on the border with Kenya. Some 200,000 people of eight different ethnicities live in the Omo Valley, with another 300,000 around Lake Turkana in Kenya. Many are reliant on the river for their food security: on fish in the river and lake, and on crops and pastures grown in the fertile soil deposited by annual natural floods. Gibe III Dam—at 243 meters the tallest in Africa, and generating some 1,800 MW of hydroelectric power—was built with a dual aim: to provide energy for the booming economy and for export, and to deliver an irrigation complex for high-value agricultural development. It was also said that the dam would become a tourist attraction, of socio-economic benefit. Both Ethiopian and Kenyan governments support the dam and have disputed claims of a negative environmental impact, but critics point to such adverse effects as the cessation of natural floods, diminishing biodiversity, falling water levels in Lake Turkana, and the displacement of traditional peoples who have lived for centuries in a delicate balance with the environment. The photographer visited the Omo Valley during the final years of the dam’s construction, with the aim of producing a meditation on how important investments can nonetheless put the human-environment balance at risk, and on how the changes brought about by the presence of such large amounts of money disrupt existing equilibrium.","Shutter Speed

                                Attacks on the villages of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and the burning of their homes, led to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing into Bangladesh on foot or by boat. Many died in the attempt. According to UNICEF, more than half of those fleeing were children. In Bangladesh, refugees were housed in existing camps and makeshift settlements. Conditions became critical; basic services came under severe pressure and, according to a Médecins Sans Frontières physician based there, most people lacked clean water, shelter and sanitation, bringing the threat of disease.

In January 2020, the International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to take measures to protect the Rohingya community from genocide, but Myanmar says it is targeting militants, not civilians. Bangladesh has informed the UN that it will no longer accept Rohingya refugees.","Shutter Speed

                                On 10 July 2017, after months of fighting, the Iraqi government declared the city of Mosul fully liberated from ISIS, although fierce fighting continued in pockets of the city. Mosul had fallen to ISIS three years earlier, and the battle to retake it had begun in October 2016.

In effect, the reconquering of Mosul comprised two parts: the battle for the eastern half of the city, and that for the west, across the Tigris River. East Mosul was recaptured by the end of January 2017, but the offensive on west Mosul, particularly the densely built-up Old City, proved more difficult. Large areas of the city were left in ruins, and huge numbers of civilians were caught in the crossfire as battle raged.

A United Nations report gives an absolute minimum of 4,194 civilian casualties during the conflict, with other sources putting the figure much higher. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed to extensive use of civilians as human shields, with ISIS fighters attempting to use the presence of civilian hostages to make certain areas immune from military operations.

After months of being trapped in the last remaining ISIS-held areas of the city, the people in west Mosul were severely short of food and water. Those who chose to remain in the city rather than go to one of the many camps for displaced people, initially relied on aid in order to survive.","Shutter Speed

The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim minority group in Rakhine State, western Myanmar.

Violence erupted in Myanmar on 25 August after a faction of Rohingya militants attacked police posts, killing 12 members of the Myanmar security forces. Myanmar authorities, in places supported by groups of Buddhists, launched a crackdown, attacking Rohingya villages and burning houses.

The African penguin, once southern Africa’s most abundant seabird, is now listed as endangered. Overall, the African penguin population is just 2.5 percent of its level 80 years ago; research conducted on Halifax Island by the University of Cape Town indicates the population has more than halved in the past 30 years. Historically, the demand for guano (bird excrement used for fertilizer) was a cause of the decline: the birds burrow into deposits of guano to nest. Human consumption of eggs and overfishing of surrounding waters are also seen as causes. In the seas around Halifax Island sardine and anchovy—the chief prey of the African penguin—are now almost absent.","Shutter Speed

Mice were introduced to the island by sealers in the 1800s and co-existed with the birds for almost 200 years. In 1991, South Africa eradicated feral cats from Marion Island, but a subsequent plan to do the same to the mouse population failed to materialize. An expanding population and declining food sources led the abnormally large mice to attack albatrosses and burrowing petrels.

                                A young southern white rhinoceros, drugged and blindfolded, is about to be released into the wild in Okavango Delta, Botswana, after its relocation from South Africa for protection from poachers.

Southern white rhinos are classified as ‘near threatened’. Rhinoceros horn is highly prized, especially in Vietnam and China, for its perceived medicinal properties, and in places is used as a recreational drug. Horns can fetch between €20,000 and €50,000 per kilogram. Poaching in South Africa rose from 13 rhinos a year in 2007 to a peak of 1,215 in 2014, and although these figures have declined slightly since then, losses are still unsustainable. Botswana is saving rhinos from poaching hotspots in South Africa and re-establishing populations in its own wildlife sanctuaries.","Shutter Speed

                                Breast ironing is a traditional practice in Cameroon that involves massaging or pressing the breasts of pubescent girls in order to suppress or reverse breast development. The practice is carried out in the belief that it will delay maturity and help prevent rapes or sexual advances. Breast ironing is usually done by the girl’s mother or an older relative. Techniques differ from region to region. Some people bind the breasts with a belt, others heat a grinding stone, spatula or pestle and use it to press or massage the breasts. Although largely a Cameroonian practice, breast ironing does occur in some other countries across West and Central Africa. Local NGOs estimate that around 25 percent of women in the Cameroon have undergone some form of breast flattening; in some areas that rises to over 50 percent. Mothers explain that the painful procedure is an act of love, to make sure their daughters don’t get pregnant and miss out on school or jobs. There is little medical research on the psychological and physical consequences of breast flattening, but according to the United Nations Population Fund, the practice exposes girls to numerous health problems deriving from tissue damage and infection.","Shutter Speed

Makoko has a population of around 150,000 people, many of whose families have been there for generations. But Lagos is growing rapidly, and ground to build on is in high demand. Prime real estate along the lagoon waterfront is scarce, and there are moves to demolish communities such as Makoko and build apartment blocks: accommodation for the wealthy. Because the government considers the communities to be informal settlements, people may be evicted without provision of more housing. Displacement from the waterfront also deprives them of their livelihoods. The government denies that the settlements have been inhabited for generations and has given various reasons for evictions, including saying that the communities are hideouts for criminals. Court rulings against the government in 2017 declared the evictions unconstitutional and that residents should be compensated and rehoused, but the issue remains unresolved.","Shutter Speed

                                Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city and the country’s financial and industrial center, was a key battleground in the war between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and rebels who wanted to overthrow him. For four years the city had been roughly divided in half, with the opposition controlling the east and the government the west. As fighting intensified in 2016, the rebels became increasingly besieged. Of the roughly 250,000 people who remained trapped in eastern Aleppo, around 100,000 were children. Besieged civilians faced severe food and fuel shortages, and basic infrastructure and healthcare facilities were obliterated.

Despite several international attempts at negotiating a ceasefire and allowing civilians passage out of eastern Aleppo, fighting escalated and people remained. Civil defense workers said civilians were mistrustful of government offers of safe passage; the government said rebels were preventing people from leaving. Some were simply reluctant to abandon their homes and property. On 15 December the warring sides reached a ceasefire deal, and on 22 December, following days of evacuations, the Syrian government announced that it had taken control of the city.",,,,,,2017 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Spot News, Stories,{'Bashar al-Assad'},{'Hayy Aqyul'},1.0,1.0,{'Syria'},1.0

Balochistan, which borders on Iran and Afghanistan, is affected by Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence and a separatist Baloch ethnic insurgency. Lawyers form a particular target of attacks, severely impacting the judicial system.","Shutter Speed

CrossFit is a fitness regime that draws on such sports as high-intensity interval training, weightlifting and gymnastics. Hilton participates in grueling workouts using equipment she has adapted using everyday hardware materials—this proved simpler and cheaper than trying to find equipment on the internet. Hilton juggled her intensive training regime with work, life and coaching commitments in order to qualify for the Adaptive Seated RX division of the international CrossFit fitness festival. She finished in the top five in the category.","Shutter Speed

It was set up to resist the idea that gay men were not suitable for a heavily masculine sport like rugby, and to counter the stereotypes surrounding gay athletes. Canada is now host to three gay-oriented teams, after the Montreal Armada joined the Ottawa Wolves and Muddy York. A fourth, the Vancouver Rogues, dissolved after players felt they had brought sufficient awareness to issues of inclusion, and now play on mixed teams. Muddy York RFC competes against mainstream teams in the Toronto Rugby Union, and travels to play against other gay teams.","Shutter Speed

                                In 1905, around 1,000 Koreans arrived in Mexico aboard the SS Ilford. They alighted in Salina Cruz in the state of Oaxaca, and then traveled by steamboat to Progreso, on the Yucatán Peninsula. The Koreans had departed an impoverished country and were promised future prosperity, but were destined instead to be indentured laborers—a form of bonded contract labor in which they were forced to work for low wages for four or five years.

The immigrants were set to work on henequen plantations, in harsh conditions. Henequen, a variety of agave plant used in rope making, generated vast revenues for Mexico. The immigrants (most of whom were men) worked side-by-side with local Mayans, often learning the Mayan language in preference to the Spanish of their masters, and many went on to marry local Mayan women. Most laborers expected to return to their homeland, but by 1910 Korea had been incorporated into the Japanese Empire, and so many decided to stay in Mexico. With the decline in demand for henequen after World War I, a number of Koreans went on to seek work elsewhere in Mexico and in Cuba. Second-generation Korean-Mexicans often lost their parents’ language and traditions. More recently, young people of Korean descent are proving eager to pick up again on their cultural heritage.",,,,,,2017 Photo Contest, 1st prize, People, Stories,{'Joaquin Poot Lee'},{'SS'},1.0,1.0,"{'Progreso', 'Cuba', 'the Japanese Empire', 'Korea', 'Mexico', 'Henequen', 'Salina Cruz', 'Oaxaca'}",8.0

Mental illness in South Sudan is often attributed to witchcraft. This means the mentally ill are frequently ostracized, and regarded as a danger to society. Many end up in prison. South Sudan’s animist and Christian cultures treat mental illness with traditional cures or prayers, practices that many professionals see as insufficient or as sheer profiteering. Juba has only a handful of qualified psychiatrists and psychologists, but international NGOs are working with the Sudanese authorities to improve conditions for the mentally ill.","Shutter Speed

                                Ye Ye, a 16-year-old giant panda, lies in a training enclosure at the Wolong reserve, Sichuan, China. Her cub, Hua Yan was released into the wild after three years of training.

                            
                                                    
                                Once endangered, the giant panda is now considered vulnerable, meaning at lower risk of extinction. China’s efforts to eliminate poaching and to protect the panda’s habitat played a large role in increasing numbers. Two-thirds of the world’s wild pandas live in nature reserves in the bamboo-rich forests above the Sichuan Basin. The original decline of the species was attributed in part to the disappearance of bamboo, the panda’s principle food, as forests were converted to farmland. China’s restoration of the animal’s habitat has led to an increase in geographic range, and animals bred in captivity are now being reintroduced to the wild. Pandas living in captivity need to undergo training to learn how to cope in the wild. The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda oversees three panda bases in Sichuan, dedicated to reintroducing the bears to nature: Bifengxia, Dujiangyan and Wolong.","Shutter Speed

                                A black rhino, poached for its horn, is found dead at Hluhluwe Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa. It is suspected that the killers came from a local community approximately five kilometers away, entering the park illegally, shooting the rhino at a water hole with a high-powered, silenced hunting rifle.

                            
                                                    
                                Demand in Asia for rhino horn—traditionally valued for its medicinal properties—is rising steeply, as increasing prosperity in the region means more people can afford to pay the extremely high prices involved. This puts growing pressure on a species already threatened with extinction. In 2007, South Africa, home to 70 percent of the world’s rhinos, reported losing just 13 to poachers%3B by 2015 that had risen to 1,175. Unlike elephant tusks, rhino horn grows back when cut properly. Rhino rancher John Hume is among those attempting to end the international ban on trading in rhino horn, and to farm rhinos commercially, a move fiercely opposed by conservationists, who say a legal trade could doom rhinos.","Shutter Speed

                                A carpet of monarch butterflies covers the forest floor of El Rosario Butterfly Sanctuary in Michoacán, Mexico, after a snowstorm. The severe storm hit the mountains of Central Mexico on 8 and 9 March, just as wintering colonies of the butterflies were starting their migration back to the USA—a journey of more than 4,500 kilometers.

The butterflies are surprisingly resilient and can survive several days in sub-zero temperatures as long as they remain dry, but it was unclear how badly the snowstorm affected the colonies. After a general decline in monarch populations, with numbers dipping by 90 percent since the 1990s, there had been a recent increase, and the winter had been seen as a possible turning point for the species.","Shutter Speed

                                Table Rock is a small rural community in the northeast part of Pawnee County, Nebraska, in the USA. It was named for a unique rock formation near the Nemaha River. In 1992, Table Rock had 308 citizens%3B in a 2015 census the population was 255. Most people living in Table Rock spend their whole lives there. Some try moving to larger places, but often return to raise their children in their hometown. As with many other Midwestern towns, work is difficult to find. Farms around Table Rock provide employment for some, others seek jobs in neighboring communities.

The photographer is interested in the mundane aspects of everyday life. He first went to Table Rock in 1992. He and a colleague had been commissioned to do a story on American life, and the colleague closed his eyes and put his finger on a point he thought was the middle of the map. That turned out to be Table Rock. In 2009, the photographer became curious about what was happening in the town and so returned. He made a few further visits in the years that followed. For the most part, little had changed.","Shutter Speed

                                Since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, the country has followed a strictly conservative theocratic line. Western cultural influences have been severely restricted. An estimated 60 percent of Iran’s population is under 30 and have little knowledge of their country before the revolution, yet all the trappings of Western youth and modernity are now beamed into homes via the internet and (as yet still illegal) satellite television. Daily, millions of young people engage in activities that are officially illegal and can carry severe penalties. The Basij—a volunteer militia—polices public morals, on the lookout for such offences as women showing too much hair, or couples inappropriately holding hands.

The photographer was born and raised in Iran and has been photographing his country for 15 years. He aims to document parts of Iran’s complex society showing less-observed areas of daily life. He also turned his focus on some Iranian immigrants in the US, to see how they had kept their language, culture and traditions alive.","Shutter Speed

                                Donetsk and Luhansk are two self-proclaimed, pro-Russian ‘People’s Republics’ in the Donbass region in easternmost Ukraine. A 2001 government census showed that 74.9 percent of the population in the Donetsk region and 68.8 percent of the Luhansk region have Russian as a mother tongue. In April 2014, a month after Russian forces had entered Crimea in southern Ukraine, pro-Russian separatists seized parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian government launched a military operation in response, and over the course of the summer the conflict escalated into full-scale hostilities. In August 2014 (and again in February 2015) Russian forces gave active support in training and equipment to the rebels. A ceasefire was signed in September 2014, but was repeatedly violated before breaking down completely.

The photographer first went to Luhansk in the early summer of 2014, and witnessed conditions change as hostilities intensified. He believes that the most important side to any conflict is the third one: that of the ordinary people caught up in the violence. Civilians in Luhansk and Donetsk had to survive often without running water or electricity, under repeated shelling, experiencing the destruction of their homes and the deaths of friends and relatives.",,,,,,2017 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Long-Term Projects, Stories,set(),set(),0.0,0.0,"{'Luhanskaya', 'Donetsk', 'Luhansk', 'Ukraine', 'Crimea'}",5.0

                                The Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF), backed by US and coalition forces, began an offensive to retake Mosul from the Islamic State group (IS) in October. IS had been entrenched in Mosul for more than two years. The Iraqi government initially dropped leaflets over the city, asking residents to stay in their homes. Many people were caught in the crossfire, but some chose to escape. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) states that more than 96,800 people were displaced in Mosul between October and December, while around one million civilians remained trapped in the city, running low on food and drinking water and facing increasing retaliation by IS fighters. The Iraqi strategy of asking civilians to remain was aimed at averting a humanitarian crisis set off by hundreds of thousands fleeing, and at facilitating resistance to IS from within the city. As numbers caught up in the battle escalated, and fears of IS retaliation grew, many preferred to face the risks of leaving.","Shutter Speed

Thousands turned out to watch the procession pass.

Babies with the condition are born with an abnormally small head, or the head stops growing at birth. The Zika virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, generally causes mild, flu-like symptoms, and the exact causal link to microcephaly—an otherwise rare condition—is not fully understood. The World Health Organization recorded 2,289 Zika-linked microcephaly cases in Brazil from the beginning of the outbreak in 2015 to the end of 2016, and declared the Zika virus an international public health emergency. A large number of the Brazilian cases occurred in the northeastern interior, one of the poorest regions of the country, where many people had to travel long distances to reach a hospital for treatment.","Shutter Speed

Evans had travelled to Baton Rouge to protest the death of Alton Sterling, who was shot at close range while being held to the ground by two white police officers on 5 July. The fatal shooting of Sterling came at a time of heightened tension in the US over the deaths of black men at the hands of the police. Data collected by The Counted, an initiative set up by The Guardian to record such fatalities, found that in 2016, black males aged 15-34 were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by law enforcement officers.

                                When conflict erupted in Syria in 2011, Turkey initially operated an open-door policy to people fleeing the violence. In June 2015, new fighting in northern Syria, between members of the so-called Islamic State (IS) and a coalition of Kurdish and opposition militia, led to a sharp increase in border crossings, as civilians fled both airstrikes and ground battles. The UNHCR said that in the first half of June, fighting in the region led to more than 23,000 refugees fleeing into Turkey, with some 70 percent of those being women and children. Turkey began to take measures to limit the numbers of refugees coming into the country, so people attempted other ways of entering.",,,,,,2016 Photo Contest, 3rd prize, Spot News, Stories,"{'Tel Abyad', 'Akçakale'}","{'Akçakale', 'Islamic State', 'UNHCR'}",2.0,3.0,"{'Syria', 'Turkey'}",2.0

Douma and other small towns in Eastern Ghouta came under heavy shelling and bombardment. Responsibility for the attacks was difficult to verify. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that parts of the region had been under continuous siege by government forces since 2013, resulting in severe shortages of food and medical supplies. People fleeing the attacks, and the deprivation caused by the siege, joined the millions of internally displaced people within Syria and the 4.6 million registered refugees abroad.","Shutter Speed

Refugees attempted to find ways through before the fence was completed on 14 September. This group had spent four hours hiding in an apple orchard at night, dodging border police, being gassed with pepper spray, and trying to find a way across.","Shutter Speed

The sport is part of a larger West African form of traditional wrestling, but differs in that the Senegalese version allows blows with the hands. It has its historical roots in preparations among warrior classes for battle, and is still seen as an indication of masculine strength and ability. Tournaments involve drumming and dance, and wrestlers practice a range of rituals—such as the presentation of amulets, and rubbing with lotions—to increase their chances and ward off bad luck.","Shutter Speed

                                On 26 April 1986, a nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the town of Pripyat, Ukraine, resulted in large amounts of radioactive material being released into the atmosphere. Radioactive particles—the contaminating effects of which can last for years—were carried downwind through much of the western USSR and Europe. Five months after the disaster, a girl named Mariya was born in Kiev, 100 km south of Chernobyl. She grew up suffering from chronic thyroiditis, one of the results of radiation poisoning. These images represent 30 years of her life. In April 2015, the photographer’s assistant discovered 20 rolls of unused color film in Pripyat, with a 1992 expiry date. The photographer set about shooting images taken in places which related to the Chernobyl accident: the apartment of somebody displaced by the accident, a hospital treating people with radiation illnesses, an apartment where nuclear workers were living at the time of the accident, a school for children whose parents used to live in the restricted zone around Chernobyl, and current pictures of the plant. When it came to processing the negatives, the photographer had to improvise and experiment. The chemicals he needed for developing the old Ukrainian color film were no longer available, but he found that using black-and-white chemicals on over-exposed film gave a result that suited his purposes. He wanted to capture the current situation, but also to help people imagine the invisible problems, such as those experienced by Mariya. Mariya was admitted into an intensive care unit soon after being born. Much of her childhood was spent in different hospitals, without receiving a diagnosis. She feels that so much time lying in hospital without her mother has had a long-term effect on her character. When Mariya was 19, her symptoms grew more acute. Her heart rate accelerated to 120—130 beats a minute, and she developed a severe tremor, which put an end to her studies to be an architect. She could not understand what was happening, and found the whole experience frightening. She says that it bothered her to be branded as ‘disabled’, that she had the feeling the word would bury her. She also felt in some way guilty for her predicament. It took Mariya many years to work through these emotions, but she no longer feels guilty, nor does she blame anyone. She needs a lot of medication, but her heart rate is more under control. After re-establishing contact with her estranged parents, she feels like she has been re-living much of what she missed in her childhood. And she has been embarking on new ventures—on travel, and taking up painting. She says she no longer feels overwhelmed by life.",,,,,,2016 Photo Contest, 1st prize, People, Stories,{'Mariya'},set(),1.0,0.0,"{'Kiev', 'Pripyat', 'Mariya', 'USSR', 'Chernobyl', 'Ukraine'}",6.0

As the price of gold fell, people began to dig ever deeper to find enough to make a daily wage. Arzuma works some 20 meters underground. Mining under these conditions is backbreaking labor during which miners are constantly breathing in dust. The subsequent process of extracting the gold exposes them to mercury and cyanide.","Shutter Speed

Sumatran orangutans are on the IUCN Red List as a 'critically endangered' species, with around 7,000 living out of captivity. Borneo orangutans, the world’s largest tree-dwelling animal, are listed as endangered. Numbers of both are decreasing sharply. Orangutans are facing a crisis in habitat, as logging activity, conversion to agriculture, and fires consume their forests. They are also poached for the illegal pet trade. In 2015, wildfires—spurred by drought and the effects of El Niño—devastated vast areas of rainforest in Sumatra and Borneo, driving out orangutans and putting them in increased danger from poachers, and into conflict with farmers as they searched for food.","Shutter Speed

                                North Korea emerged in the upheaval following the end of World War II and the Korean War, and for six decades has been one of the most isolated and secretive nations on earth. Its history is dominated by the founding president, Kim Il-sung, known as the Great Leader. He shaped political affairs for almost half a century, establishing a totalitarian state which shut itself off from the outside world. A leadership cult has grown around the Kim dynasty, passing from Kim Il-sung to his son Kim Jong-il (the Dear Leader) and grandson, the current supreme leader Kim Jong-un. The country is run along rigidly state-controlled lines. Local media are strictly regulated, and the foreign press largely excluded.

                                Paula Anderson, wrapped in plastic trash bags to keep dry, leaves an event held for homeless veterans. When Paula told her army commander that she had been drugged and raped by a fellow soldier, she was shipped off to Korea. Her army career lasted six years, but her MST has followed her for 20 years. She became homeless in February 2015, after her release following 17 months in jail.

                            
                                                    
                                The incidence of sexual assault on women by their colleagues in the US Armed Forces is high. Many women see reporting attacks to their commands as difficult or futile. Very few sexual assaults are reported and only a fraction of those get to court. The trauma of a sexual assault, and the ensuing emotional distress, may lead to long-term personal issues. The effects of Military Sexual Trauma (MST) include drug and alcohol dependence, homelessness, and an increased risk of suicide. Challenges for women veterans are not always met by existing vet programs. Women veterans form the fastest growing segment of the homeless population of the US, and are four times more likely to be homeless as other women. The photographer, who comes from a military family, made it her mission to document the lives of MST survivors, and to keep the issue talked about. She learned that they formed a network of support for each other, but that homeless survivors were a hidden population, who rarely spoke to others about their experiences.","Shutter Speed

                                Just before noon on 25 April, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck northwest of the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, followed by a series of severe aftershocks. More than 8,000 people were killed, and some 21,000 injured. Homes, buildings and temples were destroyed in the capital, but rural mountainous districts were hardest hit. Although relief teams arrived from around the world to assist, people in remote villages, rendered inaccessible by the quake, had initially to fend for themselves. Across the region some 2.8 million people were made homeless.","Shutter Speed

Figures are hard to confirm, but the Violations Documentation Center in Syria (VDC), an independent NGO, puts civilian fatalities in and around Douma at 1,740 in the first half of 2015 alone.

The warehouse, owned by Ruhai Logistics, was registered for storage of hazardous chemicals. Safety regulations stipulating that public buildings should be at least one kilometer away were not heeded. A series of explosions at the facility resulted in damage to some 17,000 residences and 8,000 vehicles, killing over 170 people (95 of them firefighters) and injuring hundreds more.

Many people drowned after boats capsized or sank, and those who survived the crossing often arrived in a state of hypothermia.","Shutter Speed

No country may exploit mineral resources or exert territorial claims. The treaty is currently in force until 2048, but a number of countries have an eye on asserting greater influence before the renewal date. Some are looking to the strategic and commercial possibilities that exist right now, such as iceberg harvesting (Antarctica is estimated to have the biggest reserves of fresh water on the planet), krill fishing, and expanding global navigation abilities.","Shutter Speed

                                Abdoulaye (15) is imprisoned in a room with security bars, in a daara in western Senegal, to prevent him running away.

                            
                                                    
                                Koranic boarding schools in Senegal, known as daaras, traditionally give children between the ages of five and fifteen a religious education and teach them Arabic. But the schools are highly unregulated, and conditions in many are poor, with near-starving children living in overcrowded, unsanitary circumstances. The pupils, or talibés, are beaten and sometimes kept in chains for hours on end. Some are the victims of child-trafficking. Talibés are frequently made to beg on the streets for up to eight or nine hours a day, giving all they collect to their marabout (teacher). Human Rights Watch reports that more than 30,000 boys are forced to beg in the Dakar region alone. Many choose to live on the streets rather than return to their daara. Parents often send their children to daaras in the hope of giving them a better education, or because they cannot afford to keep them at home. In July, the Senegalese government adopted a law prohibiting begging and trafficking, but has been accused of \inadequate progress\"" at improving the situation by Human Rights Watch.

Protests had taken place almost daily after the release of a police car dashcam video showing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being fatally shot by a Chicago police officer. McDonald, who was armed with a knife, was shot 16 times by the officer, who said he feared for his life. The protest was one of a number that occurred throughout the year, following episodes elsewhere in the country where police were accused of using excessive force against black men, often involving fatal shootings.","Shutter Speed

                                Adam Abdel (7) was badly burned when a bomb dropped by a government plane landed next to his family’s home, in rebel-held territory in Darfur. Adam was blown out of the house by the force of the blast, and his clothes caught fire. Two weeks later, his burns were still healing. Treatment was hard to obtain, because the government continued to deny NGOs and relief workers access to rebel-held territory.
Unrest in Darfur ignited in 2003, after the government of President Omar al-Bashir cracked down on an insurgency. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced.","Shutter Speed

                                Prison authorities bring Balal to the scaffold.
Although exact figures are not known, Iran is thought to execute more people than any country in the world, apart from China. Hangings are frequently held in public, and sometimes a murder victim’s family may participate in the punishment by pushing the chair from under a condemned prisoner.
On 15 April, a young man identified only as Balal was due to be hanged for stabbing a friend, Abdollah Hosseinzadeh, to death during a street brawl. Hosseinzadeh’s mother was present at the hanging, but at the last minute, instead of pushing the chair, she slapped Balal’s face in an act of symbolic forgiveness. Such an act puts a stop to the execution, though the victim’s family does not have a say in any subsequent jail sentence.","Shutter Speed

Balls delivered by fast bowlers in cricket can surpass speeds of 150 kilometers per hour. Hughes was wearing a helmet, but was hit in an unprotected area just behind his left ear. After undergoing surgery in hospital, Hughes was placed in an induced coma. He died on 27 November, having never regained consciousness, three days before his 26th birthday. His death evoked an enormous reaction, internationally as well as nationally. In a symbolic gesture, the official scorecard for his final match was adjusted from ‘retired hurt’—the usual wording for a player who has left the field after injury—to ‘63 not out’, which would indicate that he was still batting when the match ended.","Shutter Speed

Carnivorous plants have evolved in a number of different parts of the world, generally in response to low-nutrient environments. While other plants are struggling to find nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, carnivorous plants gather food in ingenious ways. Until recently, scientists thought all carnivorous plants operated in a similar way, catching insects and digesting them. But we are now discovering plant-animal interaction to be more complex, and to involve all manner of sophisticated symbiotic relationships.

                                When a male sheep crab (Loxorhynchus grandis) is infected by Heterosaccus californicus, a parasitic barnacle, it stops developing fighting claws, and its abdomen widens, providing a womb for the barnacle to fill with its brood pouch. Nurtured by the crab, the eggs hatch. Thousands of baby barnacles disperse to infect anew.
Many parasites not only feed off their hosts, but appear to manipulate the host’s behavior in a way that is advantageous to the parasite’s life cycle. Recent research indicates that this influence occurs at a genetic level—certain parasite genes seem to be able to take control of the host’s brain. Research has shown that in some cases a single parasite gene is responsible for altering the host’s behavior, though in most instances it is thought that the phenomenon is brought about by a combination of genes.

Globally, the demand for palm oil (used in food, cosmetics, and as bio-fuel) is growing rapidly, and Indonesia is a market leader. The loss of their rainforest habitat, largely to make way for palm plantations, has brought orangutans almost to extinction in Indonesia. The SOCP has rescued some 280 orangutans from plantations, poachers and pet-owners, and returned more than 200 to the wild.","Shutter Speed

                                Many factories are found in the western part of Qian’an. Every day, their chimneys discharge thick smoke. Many large steel factories are located there, such as Qiangang, Jiujiang, Songting, Yanshan. That area is covered with smoke and dust. It is one of the cities with the most serious pollution in China.
China is now the world’s second-largest economy. Its economic development has consumed lots of energy and generated plenty of pollution. A habit of directly discharging unprocessed industrial sewage, exhaust gas and waste material has led to pollution of farmlands, grasslands and drinking water as well as the ocean and the air. Over the past 10 years, factories have been moved from the country’s east to its central and western parts, thus greatly expanding the polluted area and increasing the severity of the the situation.
Although the environmental protection administration has shut down many small enterprises with serious pollution emission, some still continue to discharge contaminants illegally. Some have adopted covert operations, such as releasing the smoke and gas waste at night. The sewage channel is embedded into the river and ocean for discharging pollution. Western factories have large evaporation ponds to store sewage, but the sewage sinks into the ground, thus polluting the water source.
Minerals, such as coal and iron, are expanded to large-scale predatory strip mine exploitation from the original underground mining. Grassland has been turned into desert. Fertile farmland has given way to barren mountains. Herdsmen no longer have grassland. Farmers have lost their farms, their own homelands destroyed, thus causing the villagers to become displaced. Winds carry the exposed coal dust and sand, causing smog. Smog, in turn, forces middle and primary schools to close. Flights get delayed. The highway gets shut down.
The number of hospital patients with respiratory disease goes up. Food and drinking water is polluted, which leads to cancer, so common China has seen the emergence of ‘cancer villages’. China’s environmental pollution has already exerted great threats to the people’s life and security.","Shutter Speed

Kacper Kowalski is a pilot and a photographer. 'Side Effects' is a documentary project about the complex relationship between humans and nature. The photos were shot either from a paraglider or a gyroplane, some 150 meters above the ground, mainly in the area around Gdynia, in Poland, where Kowalski lives. In this work, Kowalski explores answers to questions that deeply interest him: What is the natural environment for humans? Is it an untouched, virgin landscape? Or is it a landscape that has changed, adapted to human needs?
Kowalski sees his work as offering a graphic and sometimes abstract portrait of how civilization came into being. For Kowalski, the content of the photo is less important than the reactions, reflections, and ideas that arise when looking at it. He would like the project to be a starting point for discussion about what is good or bad, necessary or optional, in the relationship between humans and nature.
The camera is never connected to a remote control, and Kowalski never uses a drone. He wants to be up there, camera in hand. And he flies alone. That means he doesn’t have to explain anything, or rely on another person’s spatial imagination. It means he can fly precisely.
Side Effects is more a method of visual storytelling than a concrete set of pictures. It is an ongoing project that will continue to be modified.","Shutter Speed

                                Jason hugs Elyssa on her fourth birthday.
The photographer, Darcy Padilla, first met Julie Baird on 28 January 1993. Julie was then 18, and was standing barefoot in the lobby of the Ambassador Hotel in San Francisco, with an eight-day-old child in her arms. She was HIV positive, and had a history of drug abuse. For the next 21 years, Padilla documented Julie’s life, and that of her family, until Julie’s death in 2010. After Julie died, Padilla continued to follow the family’s story.
Julie Baird ran away from home at the age of 14, and was a drug addict by the time she was 15, living in alleys and crack dens. Her earliest memory of her own childhood was of getting drunk with her mother at the age of six, then being sexually abused by her stepfather. When Padilla met her, Julie was living with Jack, the father of her first child, Rachel. It was through Jack that Julie became infected with HIV. Julie left Jack in 1994, because he beat her. For a while, Julie lived alone with Rachel, mostly in hotel rooms, moving twelve times in one year. In 1996, she had another child, Tommy, but the father wanted nothing to do with Julie or the baby. After five months with Rachel and Tommy at a Salvation Army live-in program, Julie moved in with a man she had met there, Paul. He was later sentenced to jail for physically abusing Tommy. After losing custody of Rachel and Tommy, Julie entered a rehab program, hoping to be reunited with them.
While in rehab, Julie, now 24, met Jason Dunn, two years younger than she and also HIV positive. Jason, too, had gone through a troubled childhood, and had run away from his adoptive family at the age of 15, surviving for a while as a male prostitute. Over the next three years, Julie and Jason had three children together: Jordan, Ryan and Jason Jr. All three, like Rachel and Tommy, were eventually taken into care by the state.  Julie and Jason served a nine-month jail sentence for abducting Jordan from hospital soon after the birth, so that he wouldn’t be taken up for adoption.
In 2005, Padilla came across an internet posting by someone looking for Julie. It turned out to be from her biological father, who for three decades had been trying to track her down. Julie and Jason moved to Alaska to be with him, and they had a year together before he died of a heart attack. Later, Padilla also located Jason Jr (now known as Zach) living happily with his adoptive parents, and arranged a meeting with Julie.
In 2008, Julie gave birth to a daughter, Elyssa, but by 2010 life was difficult again. Jason, Julie and Elyssa were living in Alaska, in a house without electricity or running water, more than 12 kilometers from the nearest town, and Julie was very ill. She died, of AIDS-related illnesses, on 27 September 2010, at the age of 36.

	After coming across Julie’s story, Jason’s adoptive parents offered to help. Jason moved with Elyssa to live near them, in a furnished apartment they provided in Portland, Oregon, but he could not cope with life as a single parent. Elyssa would often rage at him, blaming him for her mother’s death. Later, Elyssa was taken into care, first by Jason’s adoptive sister, and then by a foster family. Jason was jailed for 17 years in 2013, for sexual abuse of a minor, a charge he denies.
Elyssa continues to live with her new family, and is working on coming to terms with her relationship with Julie and with Jason. In 2014, Padilla received an email from a happily married Rachel, who had come across The Julie Project, and said that knowing her mother’s story had helped her to heal.
“The story of Julie Baird and her family is a complex one: a story of poverty, AIDS, drugs, multiple homes, relationships, births, deaths and reunion. By focusing on one woman’s struggle, I hoped to provide an in-depth look at social issues surrounding disadvantage and HIV, but I also wanted to create a record for Julie’s children of their mother’s story.”—Darcy Padilla",,,,,,2015 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Long-Term Projects, Stories,"{'Jason Jr', 'Jason', 'Rachel', 'Jordan', 'Jason Jr.', 'Julie Baird', 'Jack', 'Darcy Padilla', 'Tommy', 'Padilla', 'Julie', 'Jason Dunn'}","{'Salvation Army', 'Jason’s', 'Tommy', 'Jordan, Ryan', 'Padilla', 'the Ambassador Hotel', 'Julie and Jason'}",12.0,7.0,"{'Rachel', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'San Francisco', 'Tommy', 'Julie', 'Alaska'}",7.0

                                After weeks of rising tension following the killing of three Israeli teenagers, Israel launched a major offensive against Hamas in Gaza. Hamas had fired rockets into Israel on 7 July, after a series of Israeli air strikes in which several Hamas members had been killed. On 8 July, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, aimed at stopping the rocket attacks, and destroying Hamas capabilities, in particular the smuggling tunnels that had been built between Gaza and Egypt. The offensive lasted seven weeks, during which more than 2,100 people were killed in Gaza, 69 percent of which, according to the UN, were civilians. In Israel, six civilians and 67 soldiers were killed. Amnesty International published a report that criticized Israel’s ‘grossly disproportionate’ responses, but suggested violations of international law on both sides.","Shutter Speed

                                On 14 April 2014, 276 girls were abducted from their school dormitory in Chibok, a remote town in Northern Nigeria, by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. Schools in the area had been shut down due to Boko Haram attacks, but the girls had returned to sit their final exams. Boko Haram (whose name translates roughly as ‘Western education is forbidden’) seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in Nigeria, and opposes the concentration of wealth among what it sees as a Christian elite in the south of the country. The group opposes secular education, especially for girls, and has for some years been attacking schools, killing civilians, kidnapping pupils, and conducting forced recruitment into its ranks. Around 50 of the Chibok girls managed to escape, but the fate of the remainder remains unclear. Efforts by the Nigerian government to rescue them or negotiate their release proved ineffective, although a hashtag campaign, #BringBackOurGirls, led to extensive media attention.","Shutter Speed

The man had attempted to climb over the back wall of the complex, before collapsing in a convulsive state. A complete breakdown of mental facilities is a common stage of advanced Ebola. The man died shortly after this picture was taken.

                            
                                                    
                                The first cases of a new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone were reported in May. There is no cure for Ebola, and the fatality rate can be as high as 90 percent. The virus causes high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as internal and external bleeding. It is highly contagious, being passed on by sweat, blood and other bodily fluids. Extreme care has to be taken to avoid infection while treating patients, and in burying victims.  The healthcare system in Sierra Leone, one of the world’s poorest countries, was not equipped to cope with the disease, and assistance from foreign NGOs became crucial. By the end of the year, 2,758 people had died of Ebola in Sierra Leone. The disease also ravaged neighboring Guinea and Liberia, with 7,880 deaths reported across the three countries overall in 2014.","Shutter Speed

Some 6,000 such crossings were reported in Melilla and its sister enclave, Ceuta, in 2014. Very few migrants are granted political asylum; those who are not are taken to the mainland and handed an order to leave, but most cannot be deported as Spain does not have relevant treaties with their countries of origin.

The search-and-rescue operation was put in place by the Italian government, in response to the drowning of hundreds of migrants off the island of Lampedusa at the end of 2013. The numbers of people risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean Sea rose sharply in 2014, as a result of conflicts or persecution in Syria, the Horn of Africa, and other sub-Saharan countries.
OMN involved the Italian Red Cross, Save the Children, and other NGOs in an effort not only to rescue lives, but to provide medical help, counseling, and cultural support. Naval officers were also empowered to arrest human traffickers and seize their ships. In its one year of operation, OMN brought 330 smugglers to justice, and saved more than 150,000 people, at least a quarter of which were refugees from Syria. The operation was disbanded in October, and replaced by Triton, an operation conducted by the EU border agency Frontex, focusing more on surveillance than rescue.","Shutter Speed

Protests in February had toppled Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych from power, and installed the pro-European Petro Poroshenko as president. Separatists in the largely Russian-speaking east of the country demanded greater autonomy and stronger links with Russia.
In April, rebels seized government buildings and established self-proclaimed people’s republics in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk later asked Moscow to deploy troops in the area and consider absorbing eastern Ukraine into Russia. Clashes between government and separatist forces over the ensuing weeks resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Russia conducted a number of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, while Ukraine and NATO officials accused Russia of arming the rebels and invading Ukrainian territory with military units and personnel, a claim that Moscow denied.","Shutter Speed

                                More than 200,000 Iranian soldiers were killed in the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. After the war ended in 1988, it was revealed that the bodies of over 10,000 Iranian soldiers were still missing.

                            
                                                    
                                The Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century. More than 10,000 Iranians were reported missing in action in Iraq. Casualty figures are highly uncertain, though the numbers of dead on both sides ran into the hundreds of thousands. In Iran, people who were killed in the conflict were declared martyrs for their country, and therefore for Islam. Over 10,000 Iranian soldiers were reported missing in action, without a corpse being identified. Bodies are still being discovered and repatriated. Many mothers of missing soldiers live in hope of seeing their sons again, or finally having a body that they may bury.","Shutter Speed

                                The Chinese film industry is booming, and China already forms Hollywood’s largest export market. The Chinese Ministry of Culture and rich local investors see the industry as an instrument of soft power. Films made in China can shape how the country is viewed abroad, as well as uphold traditional values at home. For its part, and in order to circumvent restrictions in China that permit the screening of only 34 foreign films annually, Hollywood has embarked on major co-productions with Chinese studios. In these films, additional characters may be introduced, and scenes tailored, to meet the tastes and censorship requirements of the Chinese market.","Shutter Speed

                                Djibouti, at the narrow southern entrance to the Red Sea, has become a gateway for migrants from the Horn of Africa heading to the Gulf States and beyond. This photo was taken as part of a project to ‘walk the world’ following the ancient paths of human migration, from Africa to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America. When the image became World Press Photo of the Year it sparked surprise because it was different from previous winners, which often show conflict or historic moments. Instead, it is nuanced, poetic yet instilled with meaning. Kim Hubbard who commissioned the story for National Geographic said: “John managed to distill our entire story into one beautiful, moonlit image: modern day migration meets the universal desire for connection.”","Shutter Speed

                                With the football World Cup coming to Rio in 2014, and the Olympics in 2016, authorities have made a concerted effort to clean up the favelas (slum quarters) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

                            
                                                    
                                The favelas (slum quarters) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—many just a street away from rich neighborhoods—have for decades been no-go areas ruled by drug lords and vigilante militia. With the football World Cup coming to Rio in 2014, and the Olympics in 2016, authorities have made a concerted effort to clean up the favelas. The Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora (‘Pacifying Police Unit’, or UPP) was set up in 2009 to see this through. The approach is twofold. The first stage, UPP Policing, sees elite forces storming a favela and establishing a permanent police presence there. Then UPP Social is supposed to follow up with an improvement of services and infrastructure, such as in education and electricity supply. The initiative has met with partial success. Police units have been established—often for the very first time—in a number of communities, with positive results. But critics say that the UPP has concentrated on favelas closest to rich areas, that the social follow-up has not been effective, and that a true tackling of the problems in favelas needs a broader approach to the reduction of poverty.",,,,,"Camera

The result had been a victory for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi, but there were allegations of vote-rigging.

Towards the end of 2007, the severity of losses to US banks incurred over sub-prime mortgages was beginning to emerge. In the first months of 2008, rising interest rates together with increasing unemployment and a slowdown in the housing market, meant that many borrowers could no longer afford payments on their homes. Banks involved heavily in such debts, were threatened with collapse. In the following months the financial crisis spread worldwide.",,,,,,2009 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Daily Life, Stories,set(),{'the Chicago Mercantile Exchange'},0.0,1.0,{'US'},1.0

                                A tradition of land-diving, 'nagol', has existed for centuries on this South Pacific island. Men and boys build tall timber towers and leap off them headfirst from different levels, sometimes as high as ten meters.

A period of violence ensued, in what has become known as the Nanjing Massacre. As people gathered to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the event, there was still no consensus as to numbers of victims, the extent of atrocities, or duration of the massacre. China maintains that some 300,000 people were killed, with thousands of others raped and tortured. Japan disputes the figures, saying the scale of killing and rape was considerably smaller.

They work as entertainers and sell the fetishes and herbal medicines that are much in demand. The hyenas are trained to mock-attack, which draws the crowds.
The handlers capture the hyenas from caves in the wild, subduing them with traditional potions, then subjecting them to up to two months of training. The creatures are then taught to interact with humans and other animals without attacking them. Mallam and his colleagues feed the hyenas a goat every three days or so, which also helps to keep them calm, and sprinkle water on them as they dislike excessive heat.",,,,,,2006 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Portraits, Singles,{'Mallam Galadima Ahamadu'},"{'Jamis', 'Mallam'}",1.0,2.0,{'Nigeria'},1.0

The youths imitated the style of Guatemalans deported from the US for gang activity and soon became involved in organized crime, murder, extortion and drug trafficking.

UNICEF estimates that some 3.3 million children, one-fifth of the country's labor force, are employed in Bangladesh. This is despite efforts in the 1990s to curb child labor in the garment industry. Many children are forced into hazardous occupations in painting or engineering workshops, or in tanneries that use dangerous chemicals. On average a child laborer gets 60 taka (less than US$ 1) a day, about one third of the adult rate. In addition, factory owners prefer child workers because they are able to keep the workplace free from trade unionism.

The blue buildings straddling the line were the scene of discussions that lead to the 1953 armistice, ending the Korean War. Relations between capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea, one of the most secretive nations on earth, remain tense - but in 2005 the countries jointly celebrated the 60th anniversary of their independence from Japan. A four-day inter-Korean festival in August included a football match and cultural events and the countries linked fiber-optic cables to allow families separated for decades to take part in video reunions.

Although it is not certain where the contamination in West Bengal originates, it is thought that the arsenic seeps from rocks into underground water supplies. Levels of the chemical are particularly high in West Bengal and Bangladesh, where as many as 40 million people are believed to be at risk. Long-term consumption of even small amounts of arsenic can be fatal, and studies have linked prolonged exposure with cancer, diabetes and liver disease. Deep tubewells are particularly affected. From the 1970s onwards both the United Nations and the World Bank advocated the digging of such wells as an alternative to surface water bodies that had become polluted by industrial effluents and sewage.",,,,,,2006 Photo Contest, 3rd prize, Contemporary Issues, Singles,{'Jiten Sakhari'},"{'the World Bank', 'the United Nations'}",1.0,2.0,"{'West Bengal', 'Bangladesh'}",2.0

The locust invasion was the worst West Africa had seen for 15 years. By October, swarms reached as far afield as Crete, Cap Verde and Lebanon, devastating millions of hectares of crops. Adult locusts can consume their own weight in vegetation every day, stripping fields bare in seconds. Aid agencies said that the locusts had destroyed up to a third of the crop in African countries affected by the plague. The swarms were so large that usual methods of driving them off, such as banging steel pans and burning tires, were ineffective.

The procession, which takes place over 240km, dates back more than 600 years. In 1383, a peasant discovered an icon of St. Nicholas on the banks of the river, and it was found to have miraculous healing properties. The summer pilgrimage that grew up around it became one of the most popular in Russia. The icon itself was lost during an explosion in the Troitsky cathedral in Kirov in 1935, and though the procession was suppressed during the Communist era, it was revived in 1990.",,,,,,2005 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Arts and Entertainment, Singles,{'Kirov'},{'Troitsky'},1.0,1.0,"{'St. Nicholas', 'Russia', 'Kirov'}",3.0

                                La corraleja, a version of traditional Spanish bullfighting, is extremely popular along the Atlantic coast of Colombia. The tradition goes back some 200 years. Bullfighting fiestas go on for up to seven days, with animals that can weigh over 500 kilograms. Contests last from late afternoon through to the early evening, and are divided into sessions of five to 30 minutes. Teams of three to five men, either on foot or mounted on horseback, attempt to exhaust the bulls, using banderillas (spiked sticks) bearing the team colors. Each team represents a region, village, or part of a town, and the members are local sports heroes. Some team members specialize in acrobatics, which adds to the spectacle. The session ends when the bulls are exhausted, which is decided by a referee who also tots up the number of banderillas remaining in the bull to allot each team a score. Bulls are then allowed out of the ring, to return to fight the following day. At the end of the fiesta, cumulative team scores are tallied, and the winners go home with prize money that can amount to between US$ 1,000 and US$ 2,000. A trophy is also awarded to the owner of the bull that has proved most difficult to beat.",,,,,,2004 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Sports, Stories,set(),set(),0.0,0.0,{'Colombia'},1.0

                                La corraleja, a version of traditional Spanish bullfighting, is extremely popular along the Atlantic coast of Colombia. The tradition goes back some 200 years. Bullfighting fiestas go on for up to seven days, with animals that can weigh over 500 kilograms. Contests last from late afternoon through to the early evening, and are divided into sessions of five to 30 minutes. Teams of three to five men, either on foot or mounted on horseback, attempt to exhaust the bulls, using banderillas (spiked sticks) bearing the team colors. Each team represents a region, village, or part of a town, and the members are local sports heroes. Some team members specialize in acrobatics, which adds to the spectacle. The session ends when the bulls are exhausted, which is decided by a referee who also tots up the number of banderillas remaining in the bull to allot each team a score. Bulls are then allowed out of the ring, to return to fight the following day. At the end of the fiesta, cumulative team scores are tallied, and the winners go home with prize money that can amount to between US$ 1,000 and US$ 2,000. A trophy is also awarded to the owner of the bull that has proved most difficult to beat.",,,,,,2004 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Sports Action, Stories,set(),set(),0.0,0.0,{'Colombia'},1.0

As wild Atlantic salmon populations falter, salmon farming is on the increase globally, with over 274 million farmed fish present in the world's waters. Pound for pound, more pesticides and antibiotics are used than in any other livestock industry, having an impact on both human health and the environment. The waste from a large farm can be equivalent to a town with a population of 50,000 dumping sewage directly into the sea. Diseases and sea lice transfer quickly between fish packed tightly in pens, and many farmed salmon escape into the wild, spreading infection. It is estimated that over 500,000 farmed salmon escape each year in Norway alone. They breed in the wild, ultimately lowering the gene pool of wild salmon.

A long, ongoing stand-off with Iraq came to a head when a coalition of British and American forces attacked the country; the initial offensive comprised a pre-dawn bombing raid on Baghdad on March 20. This was followed by an advance of ground troops across the south of the country, and an extensive 'shock and awe' bombing campaign on the capital and other strategic cities. The Americans said they targeted sites identified as having military significance, or as possibly sheltering the Iraqi leader Sadam Hussein. By April 9, US forces had reached central Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's grip on the city was broken, but he and leading members of the ruling Baath Party had disappeared - the Iraqi leader would not be captured until December 14.

Boys belonging to the Xhosa ethnic group in South Africa are expected to undergo a circumcision ritual to mark the transition to manhood. Thousands of young men from all over the country, many of them leaving their city lives, attend circumcision schools such as this one. They are circumcised soon after arrival, and spend the next three to four weeks in seclusion with fellow initiates, learning Xhosa history and what is expected of them as an adult member of the tribe. A boy's stoicism during the ritual is considered an important part of his passage into adulthood. The ceremony also aims to instill a sense of heritage and tribal tradition, and village elders give the boys daily lessons through song and spoken word. At the end of the ceremony the boys attend a ritual bathing and are welcomed back into the Xhosa tribe as men. The ceremony is a highly private affair.

Among the adults arguing over their place in line was a group of children who waited around the supply truck to dart in when pieces of coal fell from the bags as they were being unloaded. Two of the boys had found a place beneath the truck, out of sight, where they could sift through the sand without being confronted. Scared and choking from the dust, they filled their bags with scraps of charcoal for themselves and their families.'

Australia is a dry continent, in which water is precious and topsoil fragile. Deforestation and land clearance have led to soil erosion and problems with soil salinity. Deforested areas are being replanted with pine, one of the few trees that will grow in these denuded areas. Some environmentalists would prefer the use of native eucalyptus, as they recover better from fire and don't make the soil acidic. But pine trees grow faster, and if planted in rows more than five deep can offer farmers an economic payoff.",,,,,,2003 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Nature, Stories,set(),{'Goulburn'},0.0,1.0,{'Australia'},1.0

The quest brings them into towns and on to cattle stations and sheep farms, where well-water is available and where they compete with the livestock for resources. This has led to an increasing demand by property owners for kangaroo populations to be culled.

Some weeks earlier, the Bahamas-registered tanker Prestige, carrying 70,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, had begun to break up in bad weather, 250km off the coast. The Prestige was towed out to sea after both Spanish and Portuguese governments refused permission for the ship to enter their ports. At first, oil spillage was minimal, as most compartments remained intact. But six days later the tanker broke in half, its bow and stern sinking within hours of each other and releasing an oil slick nearly 200m wide and 30km long. The slick washed ashore within days, damaging a coast that was not only rich in wildlife, but along which whole communities depended on fishing for their livelihoods. Clean-up work was conducted largely by volunteers. Environmentalists accused the Spanish authorities of a slow response to the disaster.",,,,,,2003 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Nature, Singles,{'Prestige'},set(),1.0,0.0,{'Bahamas'},1.0

Over a million tons of wildlife, the equivalent of 4 million cattle, are killed annually in Central Africa alone, seriously depleting stocks of some species. Poorer rural peoples in the Congo Basin have traditionally relied on wildlife for between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of their protein. But in recent years hunting for bushmeat has accelerated beyond sustainable levels, as demand from cities and logging settlements has grown. Illegal commercial hunting has burgeoned, threatening a number of animal populations in the area.

                                The body of a 1-year-old boy who died of dehydration is prepared for burial at Jalozai refugee camp in northwest Pakistan. According to Muslim tradition, the male family members wrap the child’s body in a white funeral shroud. In this case it was the child’s father, his uncle and an imam. The family, originally from North Afghanistan, had sought refuge from political instability and the consequences of drought in Pakistan. At the time, nearly one-fourth of the world’s refugees were from Afghanistan.

                            
                                                    
                                Decades of political instability and drought in Afghanistan had driven tens of thousands of people into neighboring Pakistan, even before the US invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. Jalozai was one of the largest refugee camps, with up to 80,000 people living in appalling conditions, many dying of dehydration and disease. It was closed in February 2002.

The impact of the Boeing 767 ignites an explosive fire, as black smoke continues to stream from the north tower, hit earlier by another hijacked airplane. 

The 9/11 attacks came in the morning, as many of the 40,000 people who worked in the complex arrived at their offices. Two more American airplanes were hijacked the same day, one flew into the Pentagon in Washington, another crashed to the ground in Pennsylvania, killing all on board. US president George W. Bush accused members of the Al Qaeda network of carrying out the attack under the orders of Osama bin Laden.

After Robert Clark saw the live television coverage of the first plane's strike, he hurried to the roof of his flat from which he witnessed and photographed the second plane hitting the World Trade Center, using a motor-driven camera.

                                Chechen rebels drag a fellow fighter into Alkhan-Kala. 

After several months of fighting the Russians, Chechen separatists withdrew from Grozny in February. The fighters used a 'safe corridor' to the west, towards the village of Alkhan-Kala. Russian soldiers did not open fire, but the corridor turned out to be mined. Several hundred were killed or lost limbs. Casualties included a number of the rebel commanders. Alkhan-Kala became overcrowded, and days after the fighters arrived, the Russians attacked the village.

Compared to the situation in 1994, when Dworzak photographed the war in Chechny for the first time, the situation in 1999 had radically changed. It became impossible for him to work, as he related in Magnum Stories (2004, p. 123): 

‘I had almost given up on it when I was called by the journalist Janine di Giovanni, asking me to work for her as a fixer and translator. I got Janine into Chechnya in February 2000 when, as it turned out, it fell to the Russians. We arrived in a village on the outskirts of Grozny, having got a guy to drive us into the hills when the city was encircled by the Russians. We hadn’t really expected anything to be happening when we got there but in fact the village and its hospitals were full of the injured and dead, who had been among the first to leave Grozny. That night Grozny was bombarded, and during the night the bulk of the rebel army left, retreating through a minefield where they were blown up. I was on the edge of the minefield and in total darkness. Half of what I got I only saw when I looked at the pictures. That was the end of the uprising. Afterwards, what was left of the rebel forces disappeared into hiding in the mountains, and they haven’t been seen since.’

The story was first published by Paris Match, followed by many other publications.",,,,,,2001 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Spot News, Stories,"{'Grozny', 'Janine', 'Alkhan-Kala', 'Paris Match'}","{'Grozny', 'Chechny', 'Magnum Stories', 'Dworzak'}",4.0,4.0,"{'Chechnya', 'Giovanni', 'Alkhan-Kala'}",3.0

The US Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that he should return to his father in Cuba, but a Florida family court granted Elian's great uncle temporary custody and a legal battle followed. The dispute sparked mass demonstrations and propaganda campaigns both in Cuba and among anti-Castro Cuban Americans.

The wave of anti-gypsy violence in Kosovo was the most severe since the holocaust of the Second World War, and thousands were displaced. By March there were around 8,000 Roma estimated to be living in Montenegro.

                                An estimated 500,000 people entered the European Union illegally in 2000. The short passage from Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar to the Spanish coast was a frequently used route. Small, overladen open boats often sunk during the crossing; hundreds of people drowned in this way. Migrants who relied on illicit traffickers had to pay up to US $3,000 to be smuggled in to Spain, often crowded into the backs of trucks. Spain tightened its immigration laws during the year. The authorities revealed that in two years they had arrested 70,000 illegal foreigners, but some estimates are that three quarters of the people who reach Spain are not detained.

The so-called ‘western route’ of unauthorized migration by sea to Europe—the 15-kilometer crossing from Morocco to Algeciras in Spain—was the first to be used. Records of irregular crossings date back to the 1970s, but after 1999 the route became the nucleus of what would grow into a strong surge of migration. Since then, migrants have also followed other paths: the central route from North Africa and Albania to Italy, and the eastern route, mainly from Turkey to Greece.",,,,,,2001 Photo Contest, 1st prize, People in the News, Stories,set(),{'the European Union'},0.0,1.0,"{'Turkey', 'Albania', 'Algeciras', 'US', 'North Africa', 'Morocco', 'Italy', 'the Strait of Gibraltar', 'Spain', 'Greece'}",10.0

The young man was a Taliban soldier until he stepped on a mine three months previously, which made him useless as a combatant. He was then sent home village, where he tried to pick up the pieces of his life.

Stephan Vanfleteren: 'While the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan I was sent there by Médecins Sans Frontières to document the state the country was in after 20 years of war. At the time the west of the country was suffering from a severe drought, in addition to poverty, hunger and disease. In this village a group of children, most of whom had never seen a camera, followed us around. We all jumped across the stream, but initially the one-legged ex-soldier stayed behind. Everyone laughed when he finally jumped. As a father of three, I was touched when I heard I had won the Children’s Award.'

People living in colonias lack access to basic services such as clean drinking water, electricity and waste management, and often live in extreme poverty. Ms Sanchez's family numbers among the millions of Americans uncounted by the national census. Officially, they do not exist in the population records that determine not only Texas’ political representation in the United States Congress, but also where new schools, hospitals, firehouses and critical social services are needed.

                                A young landmine victim leaps across a stream near Bala Morghab, in the province of Badghis, Afghanistan. The young man was a Taliban soldier until he stepped on a mine three months previously, which made him useless as a combatant. He was then sent home village, where he tried to pick up the pieces of his life.

Stephan Vanfleteren: 'While the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan I was sent there by Médecins Sans Frontières to document the state the country was in after 20 years of war. At the time the west of the country was suffering from a severe drought, in addition to poverty, hunger and disease. In this village a group of children, most of whom had never seen a camera, followed us around. We all jumped across the stream, but initially the one-legged ex-soldier stayed behind. Everyone laughed when he finally jumped. As a father of three, I was touched when I heard I had won the Children’s Award.'

                                Conflict in Kosovo between Serbian security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian separatist movement, flared up in 1998. NATO intervened in March 1999 with air strikes against Serbian forces. In the first week after NATO started its offensive against Serbia, 118,000 ethnic Albanians fled the increased Serbian violence in Kosovo. The volume of the exodus surprised governments and aid agencies. United Nations officials had expected a total of 100,000 people to leave, but nearly a million ethnic Albanians eventually fled the country.

Initially, many refugees headed to Macedonia, but the authorities feared further ethnic tension as there was already a sizeable Albanian minority living there. Extra camps were set up in Albania, where more than 50,000 people ended up near the town of Kukës. It is estimated that the vast majority of the 1.8 million people living in Kosovo had to leave their homes during the conflict. Many people were trapped inside the country itself, hiding out in forests and in the hills.

                                Conflict in Kosovo between Serbian security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian separatist movement, flared up in 1998. NATO intervened in March 1999 with air strikes against Serbian forces. In the first week after NATO started its offensive against Serbia, 118,000 ethnic Albanians fled the increased Serbian violence in Kosovo. The volume of the exodus surprised governments and aid agencies. United Nations officials had expected a total of 100,000 people to leave, but nearly a million ethnic Albanians eventually fled the country.



Initially, many refugees headed to Macedonia, but the authorities feared further ethnic tension as there was already a sizeable Albanian minority living there. Extra camps were set up in Albania, where more than 50,000 people ended up near the town of Kukës. It is estimated that the vast majority of the 1.8 million people living in Kosovo had to leave their homes during the conflict. Many people were trapped inside the country itself, hiding out in forests and in the hills.

In April 1999, countless ethnic Albanians found themselves caught between Serb paramilitary units on one side and Macedonian forces on the other. International media were given severely restricted access, making it difficult for the refugees to communicate their plight.

Harald Henden: 'The Serbian police and military were becoming increasingly brutal towards the Albanian population of Kosovo in 1998. This was a major news story, and I spent a lot of time on assignment in the province. In the spring of 1999, NATO carried out its threat of a major bombing campaign. I had no visa for Kosovo, so I went to neighboring Macedonia to see what would happen. A few days later tens of thousands of Albanians, forced from their homes by the Serbs, came pouring across the border.'

                                Trapped in a no man’s land at the border between Kosovo and Macedonia, Albanian refugees from Kosovo beg the international community for help. 

In April 1999, countless ethnic Albanians found themselves caught between Serb paramilitary units on one side and Macedonian forces on the other. International media were given severely restricted access, making it difficult for the refugees to communicate their plight.

Harald Henden: 'The Serbian police and military were becoming increasingly brutal towards the Albanian population of Kosovo in 1998. This was a major news story, and I spent a lot of time on assignment in the province. In the spring of 1999, NATO carried out its threat of a major bombing campaign. I had no visa for Kosovo, so I went to neighboring Macedonia to see what would happen. A few days later tens of thousands of Albanians, forced from their homes by the Serbs, came pouring across the border.'

Clashes between ethnic Albanians, seeking independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo, and the Serbian security forces, determined to suppress the movement, took place on a civilian as well as a military level. The protests were against increasing ethnic violence. At least 20 people - 16 Albanians and four Serbs - had been killed the previous weekend.

                                After buying some heroin, Gloria Colon (33) squats in a littered backyard to find a vein and inject the drug. 

Gloria has been living on the streets of the Bronx since her late teens, needing ten shots of heroin a day and as many tricks to pay for them. She no longer has her own teeth and her body is covered with scabs and scars. Gloria is one of several thousand homeless, drug-addicted prostitutes living on the streets of New York City.

Susan Watts: 'This photograph is part of a larger story. I spent most of the summer of 1997 documenting the life of Gloria, a homeless prostitute addicted to crack and heroin. After the story had been featured in the New York Daily News, Gloria entered a drug treatment program, and she has now been free of drugs for more than five years. She has been reunited with her family and I recently photographed her wedding. The selection of my picture for the Children’s Award made me realize how sophisticated children are to recognize the dangers of drug addiction. They sent a powerful message, and I applaud their courage and insight.'

After the story had been featured in the New York Daily News, Gloria entered a drug treatment program, and she has now been free of drugs for more than five years. She has been reunited with her family and I recently photographed her wedding. The selection of my picture for the Children’s Award made me realize how sophisticated children are to recognize the dangers of drug addiction.

Of the estimated nine to 15 million mines in Angola, only 80,000 have been cleared. Throughout the anti-colonial rebellion of the 1960s, the civil war following independence and the period when the country became a focus of international power politics, land mines have been deployed here, particularly by UNITA and the Angolan army. Since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994, peace has gradually returned. An ambitious UN-instigated program is attempting to rehabilitate Angola's infrastructure. The land mine problem is being addressed through clearance, surveying and marking, while 'mine awareness training' helps civilians avoid dangerous areas.

                                Miguel Ariel Rodríguez (left) and José Luis de León take Cassandra (1) to safety. Trapped in their home on the edge of the Guamani river, Puerto Rico, four of the nine-member Gómez family were swept off by the rising water. Her mother and three siblings did not survive the ordeal. But at dusk help was at hand for the others. The two men risked their lives to rescue them. 

What started as the kind of tropical storm inherent to the climate of the Caribbean turned into fierce Hurricane Hortense, which pelted Puerto Rico more than 45cm of rain and thrashed the island with 121kmph winds. As Hortense continued on its destructive course, it left 16 Puerto Ricans dead in its wake.

John McConnico: 'I found out I had won the Children’s Award while I was covering the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Lima, Peru. That night, I celebrated at the best restaurant in town. In Puerto Rico, the two rescuers in the picture became state heroes, as the winning picture was published in all of the local papers. Weeks later they were invited to the state address, where Governor Pedro Rossello wept as he called them Puerto Rico's bravest residents in an emotional speech broadcast live across the island. For me, that speech was the most important part of the entire process, because it was not the photographer who received the accolades, but the subjects of the picture. It is something we see far too seldom in photojournalism. While there are many awards for photographers, rarely is recognition given to our subjects. And I think all photographers would like see that happen more often. Giving back to the people we photograph is, believe it or not, a better feeling than taking the picture to begin with.'

At the onset of the Antarctic winter, all creatures flee north to escape the most forbidding environment on earth - except the emperor penguins. Not only do these regal birds brave the inclement climate, but this is also their mating season. Each impregnated female lays a single egg, which the male then incubates for nine weeks, braving blizzards and bitter cold. After the chicks have spent two months in their parent's pouch, they are left in a 'day-care center' where they huddle together for warmth.

                                After two years in camps in Zaire, an exodus of more than 500,000 Rwandans got underway. Some refugees were massacred by Hutu soldiers who tried to stop them returning to Tutsi-controlled Rwanda. The refugees often took weeks to reach their homes, scrambling for truck rides and walking by night.

                                Miguel Ariel Rodríguez (left) and José Luis de León take Cassandra (1) to safety. Trapped in their home on the edge of the Guamani river, Puerto Rico, four of the nine-member Gómez family were swept off by the rising water. Her mother and three siblings did not survive the ordeal. But at dusk help was at hand for the others. The two men risked their lives to rescue them. 

What started as the kind of tropical storm inherent to the climate of the Caribbean turned into fierce Hurricane Hortense, which pelted Puerto Rico more than 45cm of rain and thrashed the island with 121kmph winds. As Hortense continued on its destructive course, it left 16 Puerto Ricans dead in its wake.

John McConnico: 'I found out I had won the Children’s Award while I was covering the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Lima, Peru. That night, I celebrated at the best restaurant in town. In Puerto Rico, the two rescuers in the picture became state heroes, as the winning picture was published in all of the local papers. Weeks later they were invited to the state address, where Governor Pedro Rossello wept as he called them Puerto Rico's bravest residents in an emotional speech broadcast live across the island. For me, that speech was the most important part of the entire process, because it was not the photographer who received the accolades, but the subjects of the picture. It is something we see far too seldom in photojournalism. While there are many awards for photographers, rarely is recognition given to our subjects. And I think all photographers would like see that happen more often. Giving back to the people we photograph is, believe it or not, a better feeling than taking the picture to begin with.'

In some areas the practice is virtually universal, in others (such as Egypt and Kenya) it affects about half of all girls. In Senegal and Tanzania 10 to 15 percent of girls are circumcised. Of the four different types of operation, total infibulation - where only a tiny vaginal opening remains - is the most severe. Despite the pain and anguish caused by this genital mutilation few women are opposed to it, because it lends them a higher status in their communities and is a prerequisite for marriage and childbearing. It is estimated that two million girls annually have their genitals wholly or partly removed.

A vast, monumental building, it provided an appropriate setting for the giraffes and elephants sent there when they were no longer in vogue. In time, it became home to some 80,000 birds and mammals, a million fish and countless invertebrates. By the 1960s, when the exhibits had cracked and crumbled, the public had moved on to other amusements and the gallery had to close. But in the summer of 1994 the new Galerie d'Evolution reopened, and provides a contemporary context for the zoology museum.

                                Tokahewin Clifford (22) with her two sons. They belong to the Lakotas, native Americans in South Dakota, USA.

The defeat at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 spelled the end of the freedom of the Lakota, when the US cavalry killed 200 of them. Self-determination and the recovery of the Black Hills territory are the goals the Lakota have set themselves. They believe they are the Seventh Generation, who according to a prophesy by holy man Black Elk will recover the power lost when their land was conquered. The need to reconcile spiritual wealth and material poverty, dreams and the harsh realities of everyday life, characterizes their existence. Numbering some 20,000, today's Lakota live in the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Katrin Freisager: 'My aim was to produce images which did not reflect the romantic cliché we Europeans have of native Americans. I portrayed many ordinary young people, and talked with them about their future and their dreams. I wanted to find out where the new generation of Lakotas stands today and what conditions they face in the Pine Ridge Reservation, a poverty-stricken area in the heart of the affluent USA. Das Magazin made it possible for me to work on this story. I returned to South Dakota for three consecutive years to shoot material for a book about young Lakotas.'

                                Bardera, Somalia.

A mother carries her dead child, wrapped in a shroud according to Muslim custom, to a mass grave for famine victims, outside the town of Bardera, Somalia.

The famine, which claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Somalis, was the result of regional drought and civil war. While a large portion of eastern Africa suffered from this drought in this period, Somalia was the only affected nation, which also faced ongoing war. 

In January 1991, opposing clans overthrew President Siad Barre, who had led the country for 21 years. Thereafter, the centralized Somali state crumbled and the country plunged into a state of lawlessness and social breakdown as clan warlords and their militias fought for power, armed largely with weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the thousands of civilians wounded and killed in the fighting, the militias also looted food reserves and incoming food aid. In September 1992, the United Nations estimated that half of the aid sent to Somalia was stolen. 

One third to half of Somalia’s total population was internally displaced by this combination of famine and war. Many flocked to the market town of Bardera. On 23 October 1992, The New York Times reported that 11,000 women and children in a refugee camp there were in desperate need of food.

Brazil is one of the world's largest producers of charcoal, almost three-quarters of which comes from an area of virgin savannah twice as large as France, Italy and England put together. The charcoal workers live in poorly equipped campgrounds. The hard work, bad conditions and inhalation of toxic gases add up to an average life expectancy of only 55 years.

                                Bardera, Somalia.

A mother carries her dead child, wrapped in a shroud according to Muslim custom, to a mass grave for famine victims, outside the town of Bardera, Somalia.

The famine, which claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Somalis, was the result of regional drought and civil war. While a large portion of eastern Africa suffered from this drought in this period, Somalia was the only affected nation, which also faced ongoing war. 

In January 1991, opposing clans overthrew President Siad Barre, who had led the country for 21 years. Thereafter, the centralized Somali state crumbled and the country plunged into a state of lawlessness and social breakdown as clan warlords and their militias fought for power, armed largely with weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the thousands of civilians wounded and killed in the fighting, the militias also looted food reserves and incoming food aid. In September 1992, the United Nations estimated that half of the aid sent to Somalia was stolen. 

One third to half of Somalia’s total population was internally displaced by this combination of famine and war. Many flocked to the market town of Bardera. On 23 October 1992, The New York Times reported that 11,000 women and children in a refugee camp there were in desperate need of food. But Bardera, a town without any paved roads, was unprepared for the large numbers of refugees. Located at the junction of two heavily mined roads leading to the ports in Mogadishu and Kismayu, Bardera’s packed-dirt airfield could not function in the rain. Only half an hour by air from thousands of tons of food aid, in November Bardera’s death rate nevertheless continued to rise as battles between warring militias halted relief flights.",,,,,,1993 Photo Contest, 1st prize, General News, Singles,{'Siad Barre'},"{'Bardera’s', 'The New York Times', 'Bardera', 'the United Nations'}",1.0,4.0,"{'Mogadishu', 'Kismayu', 'the Soviet Union', 'the United States', 'Bardera', 'Somalia'}",6.0

In January 1992, the government of El Salvador and the FMLN guerrilla movement signed a treaty to end the 12-year civil war which killed 70,000 and caused one million - a fifth of the total population - to flee the country. It was agreed that the FMLN would become a political party. Shortly before the signing of the peace treaty the army moved into Chalatenango, traditionally an FMLN-controlled area. Assisted by human rights organizations and church organizations, rebels returned to their homes, and the FMLN was being reformed in preparation for the 1994 general election.

Santa Marta was the first village of returned refugees, who had supported the FMLN guerrillas throughout the war. In villages such as Santa Marta, rural campesinos had no access to running water or electricity for their homes.

A French legionnaire watches over the safe arrival of the supplies. Operation Restore Hope is a UN-endorsed American initiative aimed to ensure that international aid actually got through to the starving thousands. By the end of the year, however, the number of dead in Somalia was already estimated at more than a million.

Joël Robine: 'I was tired of seeing photographers and of the whole image business, but nonetheless aware of the need to bear witness. I left the others with a heavy heart, under a leaden sun. I was in Baidoa, Somalia, one of the ends of the earth, a place with nothing but military barracks for soldiers who were there to ensure the safety of the aid convoys and the nomads. As I walked through the savannah, I was able to take a picture showing the hope of a child, the hope to live. He crossed my path and smiled at me. I owe him a big thank you.'

                                Joseph Gesualdi listens to the sounds made by his unborn sister during a visit at the prenatal clinic.

Photographer April Saul first met Penny Gesualdi when she was doing a photo story on a birthing suite at a Philadelphia hospital. She kept on photographing Penny, her husband Joe, and children Joseph Jr., Marqessa and Domenica for her long-term project on an American family. The awarded story is about the arrival of baby Domenica in the family and its influence on family life.

April Saul told News Photographer in August 1992: ‘As a single mother of small children, I look for my stories close to home. I have found it especially rewarding to document the Gesualdis as they try to make a good life for their kids. Equally rewarding – and shocking to both myself and to the family – has been the response. The story won First in Feature Picture Story in Pictures of the Year and won the Budapest Award in the 1992 World Press Photo contest.

                                Camels search for untainted shrubs and water in the burning oil fields of southern Kuwait. As his army retreated from Kuwait, at the end of the First Gulf War, Saddam Hussein ordered the ignition of the oil fields that scatter the country. The effect was an ecological disaster of unimaginable scale.

Steve McCurry: 'Photographing the ecological disaster in the aftermath of the Gulf War was one of the most amazing experiences of my professional life. All of Kuwait seemed like an end-of-the-world scenario from a Hollywood production. Over 600 oil wells were on fire, turning daytime into night. The smoke was so thick that sometimes you couldn’t breathe. Animals were left to wander among the burning oil fields, looking for food and water. I followed this family of camels for about an hour in my jeep, getting out from time to time to make photographs. I guess my motivation was to show the world this tragic, needless catastrophe.'

The effect was an ecological disaster of unimaginable scale.

Steve McCurry: 'Photographing the ecological disaster in the aftermath of the Gulf War was one of the most amazing experiences of my professional life. All of Kuwait seemed like an end-of-the-world scenario from a Hollywood production. Over 600 oil wells were on fire, turning daytime into night. The smoke was so thick that sometimes you couldn’t breathe. Animals were left to wander among the burning oil fields, looking for food and water.

                                Joseph Gesualdi listens to the sounds made by his unborn sister during a visit at the prenatal clinic.

Photographer April Saul first met Penny Gesualdi when she was doing a photo story on a birthing suite at a Philadelphia hospital. She kept on photographing Penny, her husband Joe, and children Joseph Jr., Marqessa and Domenica for her long-term project on an American family. The awarded story is about the arrival of baby Domenica in the family and its influence on family life.

April Saul told News Photographer in August 1992: ‘As a single mother of small children, I look for my stories close to home. I have found it especially rewarding to document the Gesualdis as they try to make a good life for their kids. Equally rewarding – and shocking to both myself and to the family – has been the response. The story won First in Feature Picture Story in Pictures of the Year and won the Budapest Award in the 1992 World Press Photo contest. I don’t think I’ll ever forget standing in a Hungarian museum and seeing my pictures of Marqie’s and Joseph’s messy room and of Penny giving birth hanging side by side with stark photos of death and devastation in a World Press exhibition.’",,,,,,1992 Photo Contest, Individual awards, Budapest Award, Stories,"{'Joe', 'Penny Gesualdi', 'Joseph Jr.', 'Joseph', 'Joseph Gesualdi'}","{'Feature Picture Story in Pictures of the', 'Marqie', 'World Press'}",5.0,3.0,"{'Domenica', 'Marqessa', 'Philadelphia'}",3.0

In 1966, Romania's president Nicolae Ceausescu had issued a decree, banning birth control and declaring abortion illegal for any woman younger than 45 who had not yet produced four children. His aim was to expand industrialization by expanding Romania's workforce, but his harsh economic measures forced many parents to abandon their children as they could not support them.
After the 1989 revolution and the subsequent execution of Ceausescu and his wife, the legacy of his decree became painfully visible to the rest of world. Approximately 100,000 children had been confined to institutions where they lived in the most squalid conditions.

Joanne Rathe: 'When I arrived in South Africa in 1990, four years after my first visit, there was excitement in the air. In downtown Johannesburg the shocking ‘Whites Only’ signs had gone, and Nelson Mandela’s release was imminent. The challenge was to document the subtle changes that were taking place. Noticing these blacks and whites waiting together for a bus, I parked my car, grabbed my camera and took the picture. They sat frozen, displaying a universal body language that can be read by children of all ages and nationalities.'

Instead, the Soviet Union announced a freedom of choice for each member to follow its own political line, strategy and tactics without external intervention.

I hopped on a small plane that took me to the spill area. With two other photographers, I walked along the shore searching for affected wildlife. After we had found the bird, a helicopter pilot agreed to take it back to the wildlife rescue and cleanup operation. Later, thousands of other birds were also taken there.'

Ivan Kurtov told Russ Press Photo in 2011 that the winning photo was part of a photo story about Golimbievsky. Kurtov had met the veteran on Victory Day, 9 May 1989, when his press agency ITAR-TASS had sent him to a veterans meeting in Leningrad. Kurtov had staged the winning picture in honor of Golimbievsky: ""I called the Nakhimov school for naval cadets and asked them to send over some sailors for a shoot. Well, they did not send me 30 men as I requested, but only three and one officer. I was planning to shoot against the cruiser 'The Aurora,' which was docked opposite the Nakhimov school. But the big ship was too much of a distraction, and I took their photo with the city in the background."" Although ITAR-TASS approved of the image, very few newspapers ran it as their editors did not want to publish 'pathology' as they put it. Russian newspapers only started to print the picture when Kurtov won a 1st prize at World Press Photo.",,,,,,1990 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Daily Life, Singles,"{'Ivan Kurtov', 'Aurora'}","{'World Press Photo', 'Kurtov', 'Russ Press Photo', 'Golimbievsky'}",2.0,4.0,{'Leningrad'},1.0

Rosemary Kaul: 'I happened to be one of the first photographers at the scene of the oil spill disaster because I was working on a story about logging operations in Wrangler, Alaska. I hopped on a small plane that took me to the spill area. With two other photographers, I walked along the shore searching for affected wildlife. After we had found the bird, a helicopter pilot agreed to take it back to the wildlife rescue and cleanup operation. Later, thousands of other birds were also taken there.'

Charles Hires: 'I arrived to cover the 1988 floods in Bangladesh fresh from Sudan, where I had also photographed flooding. The contrast between the deluge-stricken desert land in Africa and Bangladesh, where the water levels could be measured in meters, could not have been starker. I told the story of ordinary people, who coped with the floods and carried on with their daily existence with remarkable resilience – unimaginable to someone living in the comfort of a developed society. My pictures also won the first prize in World Press Photo’s news features and the Paris Match prize for reportage.'

                                An aerial view of a village in Bangladesh, after severe floods swept the country in July and August 1988.

The simultaneous floodings of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers caused the worst inundations in the history of Bangladesh. With three-quarters of the country, including Dhaka airport, under water, the distribution of relief supplies faced almost insurmountable problems. When the water receded the final death toll was estimated at 2,600. Millions of people lost their homes.

Charles Hires: 'I arrived to cover the 1988 floods in Bangladesh fresh from Sudan, where I had also photographed flooding. The contrast between the deluge-stricken desert land in Africa and Bangladesh, where the water levels could be measured in meters, could not have been starker. I told the story of ordinary people, who coped with the floods and carried on with their daily existence with remarkable resilience – unimaginable to someone living in the comfort of a developed society. My pictures also won the first prize in World Press Photo’s news features and the Paris Match prize for reportage.'

                                Tamil guerrillas are being trained in India. In May 1986, the civil war in Sri Lanka escalated with several bomb attacks on civilian targets. These attacks were blamed on the Tamil Tigers, guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most radical of the insurgent factions fighting for an independent Tamil state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The Tamil rebels, who are mainly Hindu, believed that the government intended to increase the number of mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, the major ethnic group in Sri Lanka, in areas that are predominantly Tamil. 

Established as a tightly organised insurgent group in the 1970s, the Tamil Tigers were in control of most of the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka by 1985. Large-scale violence had erupted between the Sinhalese government and the Tamil guerrillas in the early 1980s. Fighting continued on and off until February 2002, when the government and the Tamil Tigers signed a permanent cease-fire agreement, which was soon violated by both sides. After a military campaign of 26 years, the Tamil Tigers were defeated in May 2009 by the government troops, which brought the civil war to an end.",,,,,,1987 Photo Contest, 3rd prize, News Feature, Stories,{'Tamil'},"{'Jaffna', 'the Liberation Tigers of'}",1.0,2.0,"{'Sri Lanka', 'India', 'Tamil Eelam', 'Tamil'}",4.0

Vladimir Vyatkin was one of the first Russian photographers to go to Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in December 1979. In those early years of the conflict, which was then officially called a humanitarian mission, photojournalists were not allowed to photograph the Russian troops or actual hostilities. Journalists were not even allowed to talk about them or use the word 'war'. In 2011, Vyatkin told Russ Press Photo: ""Only two years later, when the war became a subject in the official press and on television, I decided to send those pictures to World Press Photo. In an accompanying telegram I explained that the pictures had been made much earlier, but because of censorship I could not release them then.

Glenn started his career as a combat aviator in the US Marine Corps, which lead to his selection as one of the seven military test pilots selected by the NASA to become the first American astronauts. In 1965, Glenn, a member of the Democratic Party, resigned from the space program to be able to stand for election in public office. In 1974, Glenn was elected to the US senate for his home state of Ohio, an office he kept until 1999.

                                A government firing squad executes nine Kurdish rebels and two officers of the deposed Shah's police force after summary trials. The next day, another 21 Kurdish rebels and military deserters were executed.

At first, Kurdish political organisations had supported the revolution against the Shah, which brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power in February 1979. However, the relationship between the new government and the Kurds soon became fraught with difficulties, as the new Islamic republic did not make any provision for regional autonomy that the Kurds so much desired. The crisis deepened after Kurds were denied seats in the assembly of experts who were to write the new constitution. Armed conflict broke out between armed Kurdish factions and the Iranian revolutionary government's security forces and led to the declaration by Ayatollah Khomeini of a jihad against separatism in Iranian Kurdistan.

Although United Press International (UPI) submitted the photo to the World Press Photo contest, they did not commission it. The photo was commissioned by the Iranian newspaper Ettela’at, which published the image on 28 August 1979 without a credit line, to protect the photographer’s safety. A never identified staff member of UPI in Iran was tipped off about the photo and supplied with a copy by Ettela'at, which he transmitted to UPI’s European office. From there, the image was sent out in the world over the wire. Twenty-six years after the event, the photographer’s name, Jahangir Razmi, was revealed in The Wall Street Journal on 2 December 2006.",,"Focal length

Before he could crawl he had learnt to swim on his back and he is just one of thousands of Russian babies being taught to swim.

On 3 March 1978, after 14 years of civil war, Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United African National Council signed an agreement, which became known as the Internal Settlement. In 1965 Smith, prime minister of the British colony since 1964, had declared Rhodesia unilaterally independent under white minority rule. The declaration not only sparked international outrage and economic sanctions, but also a guerrilla war against white rule by different political and military factions. By signing the Internal Settlement and organizing new democratic elections, it was expected that all sanctions would be lifted. However, the settlement was condemned by the United Nations' Security Council, and as not all significant parties had been involved in the process, the civil war continued.

Sadat was the first Arab leader to bring an official state visit to Israel, where he met Begin. Sadat was also invited to speak before the Knesset. His visit to Israel, called by some the 'Sadat Initiative', marked the start of negotiations between the two countries that lead to the Camp David Accords in September 1978 and to Begin and Sadat sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. On 26 March 1979, the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty was signed.

Vyacheslav Bobkov later recalled that it was not very easy to photograph the flying birds at the station. Although these tame rooks and owls were used to the presence of human beings, they immediately flew away as soon as Bobkov turned up with his camera.

Vyacheslav Bobkov later recalled that it was not very easy to photograph the flying birds at the station. Although these tame rooks and owls were used to the presence of human beings, they immediately flew away as soon as Bobkov turned up with his camera.

                                A hostage is executed on hijacked train no. 734, near Wijster in The Netherlands.

A group of South Moluccans hijacked the train. appealing to the Dutch government to press for an independent state for their people in Indonesia. Their parents, many of whom fought on the side of the ruling Dutch during Indonesia's war of independence between 1945 and 1949, left Indonesia for fear of reprisals. For about 25 years they lived in temporary camps, often in poor conditions. They hoped to return but were gradually integrated into Dutch society. Currently some 40,000 South Moluccans live in the Netherlands.

Photographer Jan Stappenbeld was present at the World Press Photo press conference on 4 March 1976 in the Amsterdam Hilton hotel, where the winners of the 1976 contest were announced. When Plug journalist Aloys Ginjaar asked Stappenbeld if he was happy with his prize he said surprised: ‘Happy? Ofcourse I am not happy. I think it is horrible that acts of violence, such as the one I photographed, still happen in our world, even in our country. But I am a press photographer and my boss tells me to come back with news pictures. If news means the hijacking of a train, I cannot do much else than showing pictures of this. I would be a bad photojournalist if would not press the button if I encountered something that is worth photographing.’",,,,,,1976 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Spot News, Stories,"{'Ofcourse', 'Jan Stappenbeld', 'Aloys Ginjaar'}","{'the World Press Photo', 'Stappenbeld', 'Wijster'}",3.0,3.0,"{'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam', 'Indonesia'}",3.0

                                A hostage is executed on hijacked train no. 734, near Wijster in The Netherlands.

A group of South Moluccans hijacked the train. appealing to the Dutch government to press for an independent state for their people in Indonesia. Their parents, many of whom fought on the side of the ruling Dutch during Indonesia's war of independence between 1945 and 1949, left Indonesia for fear of reprisals. For about 25 years they lived in temporary camps, often in poor conditions. They hoped to return but were gradually integrated into Dutch society. Currently some 40,000 South Moluccans live in the Netherlands.

Photographer Jan Stappenbeld was present at the World Press Photo press conference on 4 March 1976 in the Amsterdam Hilton hotel, where the winners of the 1976 contest were announced. When Plug journalist Aloys Ginjaar asked Stappenbeld if he was happy with his prize he said surprised: ‘Happy? Ofcourse I am not happy. I think it is horrible that acts of violence, such as the one I photographed, still happen in our world, even in our country. But I am a press photographer and my boss tells me to come back with news pictures. If news means the hijacking of a train, I cannot do much else than showing pictures of this. I would be a bad photojournalist if would not press the button if I encountered something that is worth photographing.’",,,,,,1976 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Photo Sequences, Stories,"{'Ofcourse', 'Jan Stappenbeld', 'Aloys Ginjaar'}","{'the World Press Photo', 'Stappenbeld', 'Wijster'}",3.0,3.0,"{'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam', 'Indonesia'}",3.0

                                A mother comforts her starving child at a camp in Kao, a tiny village in the Tahoua region of central Niger.
From 1968 to 1974, severe drought devastated Niger’s livestock and crop production. The drought not only affected Niger but the entire Sahel region, where an estimated 350,000 people died of starvation in 1974. Many food production problems compounded to produce the famine, including the global energy crisis, worldwide inflation and recession, and the lowest levels of wealthy nations’ emergency food reserves since World War II due to massive crop failures and natural disasters.
World grain prices became so high that the Nigerien government could not buy and deliver enough food to its citizens. Because there was no food stockpiled in Kao, the 2,500 villagers were dependent on supply roads for relief aid. Large quantities of aid eventually arrived to the region in May, at the start of the rainy season when supply roads were impassible due to violent rainstorms. By August 1974, several people were dying in Kao each day. In September, the government announced it was replacing trucks with camel caravans to supply the Tahoua district towns.",,,,,,1975 Photo Contest, World Press Photo of the Year,,,"{'Niger', 'Nigerien', 'Sahel'}","{'Niger’s', 'Kao'}",3.0,2.0,set(),0.0

When the Carnation Revolution in Portugal made an end to the government of Marcelo Caetano, ending 50 years of dictatorship, thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique. The new head of the Portuguese government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire of the Mozambican war of independence, which had been raging in Mozambique since 1964. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on 7 September 1974.

In April 1974, Edward Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union to meet Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. He gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents and secured an exit visa for the famous Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

Ken Regan, who accompanied Ted Kennedy to the Soviet Union, made this photo after a lunch meeting with Brezhnev and members of the Supreme Soviet, when Kennedy and Teddy Jr. walked back through the halls of the Kremlin. In an 2011 interview with Culture Brats, Regan said: 'He and his son were walking down the hall and his son, Teddy Jr., had his leg amputated from the knee down maybe three months before. And I just said to myself, ""Let me stop and have them go past me."" They went past me and here they were, the two of them all alone in this hallway. You could see his son's leg bent inward from the operation, and he had a cane. And that was the moment. That picture became iconic, and won first prize at the World Press Contest, and ultimately appeared in both Time and Life magazines.'",,,,,,1975 Photo Contest, 1st prize, News Feature, Singles,"{'Edward Kennedy', 'Regan', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'Edward', 'Ken Regan', 'Kennedy', 'Mstislav Rostropovich', 'Ted', 'Ted Kennedy', 'Teddy Jr.'}","{'the Supreme Soviet', 'the World Press Contest', 'Kremlin', 'Time', 'Culture Brats', 'Moscow State University'}",10.0,6.0,"{'the Soviet Union', 'US'}",2.0

                                US Senator Ted (Edward) Kennedy and his son in the Kremlin.

In April 1974, Edward Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union to meet Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. He gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents and secured an exit visa for the famous Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

Ken Regan, who accompanied Ted Kennedy to the Soviet Union, made this photo after a lunch meeting with Brezhnev and members of the Supreme Soviet, when Kennedy and Teddy Jr. walked back through the halls of the Kremlin. In an 2011 interview with Culture Brats, Regan said: 'He and his son were walking down the hall and his son, Teddy Jr., had his leg amputated from the knee down maybe three months before. And I just said to myself, ""Let me stop and have them go past me."" They went past me and here they were, the two of them all alone in this hallway. You could see his son's leg bent inward from the operation, and he had a cane. And that was the moment. That picture became iconic, and won first prize at the World Press Contest, and ultimately appeared in both Time and Life magazines.'",,,,,,1975 Photo Contest, 1st prize, General News, Singles,"{'Edward Kennedy', 'Regan', 'Leonid Brezhnev', 'Edward', 'Ken Regan', 'Kennedy', 'Mstislav Rostropovich', 'Ted', 'Ted Kennedy', 'Teddy Jr.'}","{'the Supreme Soviet', 'the World Press Contest', 'Kremlin', 'Time', 'Culture Brats', 'Moscow State University'}",10.0,6.0,"{'the Soviet Union', 'US'}",2.0

Salvador Allende had won the presidential elections in Chile in 1970, becoming the country’s first democratically chosen socialist president. After his election, Allende began to structure Chilean society along socialist lines, expropriating US-owned copper mines and nationalizing other industries and agricultural estates. His attempt to redistribute incomes led to an economic decline with stagnant productions, decreased exports, widespread strikes, and a rising inflation, creating social unrest. Although he kept the support of many workers and peasants, Allende’s government was overthrown on 11 September 1973 by a military coup, led by Augusto Pinochet and backed by the CIA. While La Moneda palace was bombed, President Allende gave a brief farewell speech on live radio refusing to leave the palace.

Amosov (1913-2002) was a Soviet Russian and Ukrainian doctor, heart surgeon, inventor and best-selling author.

Max Alpert later recalled that for his photo essay of Amosov, he was primarily interested in the psychology of a man who can save another man's life. Alpert took a long time to prepare, reading Amosov's books and articles, and spending time with him before the shoot, which took place during two operations. Unexpectedly, the first patient died during the operation. Alpert, who tried to be invisible and as unobtrusive as possible, used fifteen rolls of 35 mm film for the whole story, from which RIA Novosti selected 31. Six were submitted to the contest.",,,,,,1974 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Photo Stories, Stories,"{'Amosov', 'Alpert', 'Max Alpert', 'Nikolai Amosov'}",{'Amosov'},4.0,1.0,"{'Amosov', 'Ukrainian'}",2.0

                                North-Vietnamese prisoners of war are being released.

The photo series shows how North Vietnamese prisoners of war are being released and exchanged with South Vietnamese prisoners of war on the other side of the river. Both had to cross the river, in order to reach their comrades on the other side of the river. Friedmann ran with the released prisoners through the water, photographing them, while his colleagues stayed on the river bank to photograph the scene. This approach earned him the World Press Photo award, but also gave him a life-threatening bacterial infection. 

The release of prisoners of war was settled in the Paris Peace Accords, which were signed on 27 January 1973 by the United States, the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The settlement included a cease-fire throughout Vietnam. Furthermore, the United States agreed to withdraw all US troops and advisors, including the dismantling of all US bases within 60 days. In return, the North-Vietnamese agreed to release all US and other prisoners of war. The release and exchange of prisoners of war started almost immediately after the signing of the treaty.",,,,,,1974 Photo Contest, 1st prize, Photo Stories, Stories,{'Friedmann'},{'the World Press Photo'},1.0,1.0,"{'the Republic of Vietnam', 'the Democratic Republic of Vietnam', 'US', 'the United States', 'Vietnam', 'North Vietnam'}",6.0

Amosov (1913-2002) was a Soviet Russian and Ukrainian doctor, heart surgeon, inventor and best-selling author.

Max Alpert later recalled that for his photo essay of Amosov, he was primarily interested in the psychology of a man who can save another man's life. Alpert took a long time to prepare, reading Amosov's books and articles, and spending time with him before the shoot, which took place during two operations. Unexpectedly, the first patient died during the operation. Alpert, who tried to be invisible and as unobtrusive as possible, used fifteen rolls of 35 mm film for the whole story, from which RIA Novosti selected 31.

                                North-Vietnamese prisoners of war are being released.

The photo series shows how North Vietnamese prisoners of war are being released and exchanged with South Vietnamese prisoners of war on the other side of the river. Both had to cross the river, in order to reach their comrades on the other side of the river. Friedmann ran with the released prisoners through the water, photographing them, while his colleagues stayed on the river bank to photograph the scene. This approach earned him the World Press Photo award, but also gave him a life-threatening bacterial infection. 

The release of prisoners of war was settled in the Paris Peace Accords, which were signed on 27 January 1973 by the United States, the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The settlement included a cease-fire throughout Vietnam. Furthermore, the United States agreed to withdraw all US troops and advisors, including the dismantling of all US bases within 60 days. In return, the North-Vietnamese agreed to release all US and other prisoners of war. The release and exchange of prisoners of war started almost immediately after the signing of the treaty.",,,,,,1974 Photo Contest, 1st prize, General News, Stories,{'Friedmann'},{'the World Press Photo'},1.0,1.0,"{'the Republic of Vietnam', 'the Democratic Republic of Vietnam', 'US', 'the United States', 'Vietnam', 'North Vietnam'}",6.0

                                Captain Edwin Alexander Hawley of the 432nd Tactical Reconnaisance Wing (TRW) US Air Force, at a press conference with captured US pilots, in the Club for International Meetings in Hanoi, Vietnam. Hawley was taken prisoner of war after his plane was shot down by a Vietcong missile.
Background story 
Captain Edwin A. Hawley Jr., a weapons and systems operator, had been based at the Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base in Northern Thailand, which served as a front-line base of the US Air Force during the Vietnam War. Udorn is only 40 minutes by air from Hanoi, Vietnam’s northern capital, and Hawley’s unit, 432ndTRW, accounted for more than 80 percent of all reconnaissance activity over North Vietnam. It also employed several F-4D fighter-bombers on strike missions over North Vietnam.
It was during one of those missions, Hawley’s plane was shot down. Together with pilot Major Robert H. Irwin, Captain Hawley Jr. was dispatched on a combat mission in their F-4D aircraft over North Vietnam on 17 February 1972. About 15 miles west of the city of Vinh in the Nghe An province, their plane was shot down. Hawley, seating at the rear, ejected from the aircraft first, as it was standard procedure for the pilot to eject second. Therefore, it was not uncommon for the crewmembers to be separated on the ground. Captain Hawley was captured by the North Vietnamese and spent the next year in prison camps in and around Hanoi.
On 7 April 1972, Life magazine published two color portraits of two captured US airmen: Captain Kenneth J. Fraser and Captain Edwin A. Hawley. According to the caption, Hawley suffered neck burns as well as a broken arm, but appeared otherwise to be treated well. On 14 February 1973, he was released, still showing signs of the injuries he received when he ejected from his aircraft. In his debriefing, Hawley stated that he believed his pilot had died. Major Irwin remained missing in action. In November 1989, it was announced that Irwin’s remains had been returned to US control by the Vietnamese, and these remains had been positively identified as being those of Major Robert H. Irwin.
Bulgarian photojournalist Stefan Tihov made the photo on assignment in Hanoi. Tihov had come to Vietnam, to cover the fighting. However, when he arrived in Hanoi, most hostilities had subsided, and he was commissioned to photograph factories, schools, and the beauty of the Vietnamese landscape. Disappointed, Tihov requested a transfer to the 17th parallel, the provisional military demarcation line between North and South Vietnam, to cover the bombardment of US aircraft by North Vietnamese artillery. His request was denied, but not much later he was assembled with other journalists in a room in Hanoi, where five captured pilots of the US Air Force were being presented to the press. Apparently, the pilots had been shot down by Soviet missiles. Tihov later remembered that he was very excited that day, watching men of his own age, dressed in prison suits, being shouted at by people who profoundly hated them.",,,,,,1973 Photo Contest, 3rd prize, Spot News, Singles,"{'Irwin', 'Kenneth J.

                                South Vietnamese soldier during the Vietnam War's Easter Offensive.

In 1969, US President Richard Nixon introduced a new strategy, called ‘Vietnamization’, aimed at ending the American involvement in the Vietnam War. Step by step, all military responsibilities were transferred to the South Vietnamese army, in order to prepare South Vietnam to defense itself against North Vietnamese attacks. 

During the spring of 1972, North Vietnam started what is now called the Easter Offensive against South Vietnam, intensifying the fighting and bombardments. The North aimed at gaining as much territory as possible and crippling the South Vietnamese army, in order to strengthen its position during the ongoing peace negotiations, while demonstrating the failure of US’ Vietnamization policy. Major battlegrounds of the Easter Offensive were the province Quang Tri and the city of An Loc.

In 1973, after negotiating a treaty with North and South Vietnam, the USA withdrew its forces from Vietnam and declared the Vietnamization process complete. However, in 1975, South Vietnam would fall to the Communist army.",,,,,"Camera

                                Queen Elizabeth II is distracted while watching a parade of elephants during her state visit to Thailand.

In a letter to World Press Photo, Horst Ossinger told World Press Photo how he made this picture: 'The official photo-session had already finished an I was quickly taking, what I thought would be my last shot on this particular session, when I discovered a peculiar look on the Queen's face. I was using a Leicaflex with 180 mm lens at the time and starter [sic] the motor of the camera.'

When Ossinger was awarded in the 1973 contest, Time magazine wrote in its People section: 'In each successive frame the royal expression got curiouser and curiouser. With her camera resting on her lap in the best tourist manner, Queen Elizabeth was cheerfully taking tea and watching a parade elf elephants while on her tour of Thailand last year. Suddenly, in a series of baffling photographs just published in London, Elizabeth registered first dismay, then pain, then a rictus of what looked like sheer agony. Was it tea? A tack on the chair?

Step by step, all military responsibilities were transferred to the South Vietnamese army, in order to prepare South Vietnam to defense itself against North Vietnamese attacks.

They had also attacked humans while waiting for the ice to form in Hudson Bay to enable them to hunt for prey. As the government threatened to kill the bears, the International Wildlife Organisation organized an airlift to save their lives.

They caught fire when the police tried to burn down a barricade, which had been built by protesting students. The president of Kyoto University had called the riot police to his campus to evict students from the clock tower and other major buildings, which had been occupied. Two thousand policemen marched into the campus at 6 am, and had cleared all buildings by noon, except the clock tower, where eight students kept the police at bay for more than 24 hours.

In the 1960s, Japan witnessed extensive and often violent student protests. An important focus of these protests was the United States-Japan Joint Security Treaty, which was signed in 1960 and renewed in 1970, and in its wake the Vietnam War. At the same time, the student activists sought educational and administrative reforms. They organized petitions, strikes, and mass street demonstrations, and occupied university buildings and other strategic locations. These massive disputes often had a paralyzing effect on teaching and research for months at an end.

On 31 January 1968, the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong launched a large-scale offensive attacking most major cities in South Vietnam simultaneously. The attacks came as a complete surprise for both the South Vietnamese Army and the American Army, as the Vietnamese Lunar New Year holiday of Tet had just begun, and a ceasefire had been announced for the duration of the holiday. Within a day, the streets of Saigon, a presumed safe hold, had turned into a battlefield.

                                A US twin-engine transport Caribou crashes after being hit by American artillery near Quang Ngai City, Vietnam. US artillery accidentally shot down the ammunition-laden plane, which crossed a firing zone while trying to land at the US Duc Pho Special Forces camp. All three crewmen died in the crash.

Hiromichi Mine made this photo probably during the American military Operation Hood River, a search and destroy mission in the Quang Ngai Province, between 2 and 13 August 1967, conducted by the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. It shows a tragic scene of war casualty, caused by friendly fire. The plane was shot down, while it was trying to land at the Base Area 121, near Ha Thanh, about 15 kilometers west of Quang Ngai City and about 40 kilometers northwest of Duc Pho.
 
Although a cease-fire order had been issued, this command was not received by the battery commander. Subsequently, the Caribou flew into the line of fire of a 155mm howitzer. The shell blew off its entire rear fuselage and tail section. The three crew members, Captain A.E. Hendrickson, Captain J.D. Wiley, and Technical Sergeant Z.A. Carter, died in the crash. Following the accident, the US Army and US Air Force tightened up their coordination procedures for air operations near artillery fire zones. The photograph was posted to every US Caribou briefing room in Vietnam, as a reminder that the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army were not the only problem for pilots in Vietnam.",,,,,,1967 Photo Contest, 2nd prize, Spot News, Singles,"{'A.E.

Together with journalist Ernst Petry, Heidemann published a series of articles in Stern about a brigade of Moïse Tshombe's mercenary army called Kommando 52. This brigade was led by former Wehrmacht officer Siegfried Müller and included several West German soldiers.

The articles and photos were published in Stern on 22, 29 November and 6 December 1964, preceding Moïse Tshombe's visit to West Germany and West Berlin in mid-December 1964.

Assigned by Stern, Gerd Heidemann traveled to Congo in 1964, to report on the Congo Crisis which had broken out after Congo's declaration of independence in 1960. Together with journalist Ernst Petry, Heidemann published a series of articles in Stern about a brigade of Moïse Tshombe's mercenary army called Kommando 52. This brigade was led by former Wehrmacht officer Siegfried Müller and included several West German soldiers.

The articles and photos were published in Stern on 22, 29 November and 6 December 1964, preceding Moïse Tshombe's visit to West Germany and West Berlin in mid-December 1964.

These privileges were resented by the Buddhists, who began establishing religious and secular organizations to create and activate more political and social awareness. The crisis was precipitated by the shootings of nine unarmed civilians on 8 May 1963 in Hue during a demonstration.

The side-effects of the drug were inadequately researched; as a consequence, some children were born with severe birth defects such as stunted growth and malformed limbs.
Thalidomide was developed in the 1950s and released into the market in 1957. The drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic. It was also used against nausea and morning sickness in pregnant women. In the late 1950s and early 1960s thousands of children were born with deformities as a consequence of thalidomide use. It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims the drug caused, although estimates ranges from 10,000 to 20,000. The drug was withdrawn from the market in 1961, when the horrible side effects became clear.

Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc sets himself ablaze to protest the South Vietnamese government’s persecution of Buddhists.

The self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc occurred during the Buddhist crisis in Vietnam, the civilian upheaval against the predominantly Catholic government of President Ngo Dinh Diem, which was supported by the United States. Although the Buddhists constituted a majority of the Vietnamese, Catholics enjoyed special privileges under Diem’s regime. These privileges were resented by the Buddhists, who began establishing religious and secular organizations to create and activate more political and social awareness. The crisis was precipitated by the shootings of nine unarmed civilians on 8 May 1963 in Hue during a demonstration. Following this incident, street demonstrations by Buddhist monks and nuns demanding political reform and religious freedom became frequent and were violently suppressed by the government.",,,,,,1963 Photo Contest, 1st prize, News, Singles,"{'Thich Quang Duc', 'Quang Duc', 'Ngo Dinh Diem'}",{'Diem'},3.0,1.0,"{'Vietnam', 'Hue', 'the United States', 'Saigon'}",4.0

On 13 August 1961, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) had started the construction of a barrier cutting off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and East Berlin. East Germany claimed that the wall was erected to protect the population from ‘fascist elements’ entering the country from the west. In reality, the wall was built to stop the massive emigration and defection from East to West. With the closing of the border between Berlin’s East and West sector, East Germans could no longer travel to West Germany.

On 13 August 1961, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) had started the construction of a barrier cutting off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and East Berlin. East Germany claimed that the wall was erected to protect the population from ‘fascist elements’ entering the country from the west. In reality, the wall was built to stop the massive emigration and defection from East to West. With the closing of the border between Berlin’s East and West sector, East Germans could no longer travel to West Germany. East Berliners working in the Western sector were cut off their jobs, while many Berlin families were split.
