## Has streaming services change the audio visual content production indutry?

## Abstract 

Digitization, as one of the key outcomes of technological growth, has led to profound changes in entertainment, and therefore in the world of cinema, as well as in many other areas. As a result, the distribution and broadcasting strategy that Netflix brought to the market turned into an amazing success story in a very short period of time.
The new approach, which is vastly different from the classic idea of ​​the Hollywood studio system, has led to advances for audiences, directors and studios in various directions. In this way, we can say that streaming services, such as Netflix, are influencing the film industry in terms of how we access movies, what material we consume and how movies are made. This dominant position places Internet platforms in a strong position in terms of film content. In the future, that authority could be key in determining what constitutes a "well-made film".
The purpose of this notebook is to investigate, through data, if platforms have changed the audio visual content production indutry. If yes, how? Is the world of production really fairer?
