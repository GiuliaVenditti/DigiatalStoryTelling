A New Age of Walls team,none,"In the United States, Donald Trump’s call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border was a central theme to his campaign for presidency. In response, The Washington Post assembled a small team to investigate the complex socio-economic ramifications of the phenomenon of governments erecting barriers.

	Samuel Granados, senior graphics editor, led the team effort to create a digital story that would provide high-level analysis of the global trend while also conveying the emotional human experiences on both sides of border walls. Zoeann Murphy, a video journalist who spent more than a decade documenting refugees and migration issues, led the video and photography components of the project. Kevin Schaul, an award-winning visual journalist, reported and built the backend of the pioneering new storytelling platform, where the user can smoothly scroll through interwoven video, text, and graphics. Berlin bureau chief Anthony Faiola added extensive experience reporting on globalization and writing. The team worked closely for several months on both the narrative and the design of the platform.

	The project was a close collaboration between The Washington Post’s graphics, video, and foreign desks. Kat Downs, graphics director, is at the forefront of interaction design and pushed the project to use advanced metrics analysis to better understanding user behavior. Reem Akkad, senior producer of video, had worked on dozens of documentaries and oversaw the video editing. The Washington Post’s foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, brought to the project the talent and vision of his international teams, including reporting from Anthony Faiola and Stephanie Kirchner in Europe, Joshua Partlow in Mexico, and William Booth and Ruth Eglash in Israel.",,,,,,

Many of his friends completed their studies in Turkey or immigrated to Germany. He continued to work in Aleppo until leaving in December 2016. He was wounded by two bullets during a peace protest in April 2012 and his father, Mohammed Mashhadi, was wounded in 2015 during his work with the Civil Defence team and later was killed in bombardment in July 2016 in Aleppo.

Ami Vitale,USA,"She has lived in mud huts and war zones, contracted malaria, and donned a panda suit—all in keeping with her philosophy of “living the story.” She is an Ambassador for Nikon and a contract photographer with National Geographic magazine and has garnered prestigious awards including multiple prizes from World Press Photos, the International Photographer of the Year prize, the Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding Reporting and named Magazine Photographer of the Year by the National Press Photographers’ Association, among others. Vitale now comes home to Montana in between making films and shooting stories about the planet’s most pressing issues, including wildlife on the edge of extinction, climate change-precipitated migration, and the struggles and triumphs of the human spirit.  She lectures and teaches workshops throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and her work is exhibited in museums, galleries, and private collections worldwide. She is a founding member of Ripple Effect Images, a collective of scientists, writers, photographers and filmmakers with a mission of creating powerful stories illustrating the very specific issues women in developing countries face. After more than a decade covering conflict, Vitale couldn’t help but notice that the less sensational—but equally true—stories were often not getting told: the wedding happening around the corner from the revolution, triumphs amidst seemingly endless devastation. As a result, she re-committed herself to seeking out the stories within and around “the story,” and remaining independent, so that she would have the freedom to shoot what she believed deserved to be shared. ​",{'Pudding'},1.0,{'Social Media'},1.0,set(),0.0

Having mastered digital technology, he worked in the IT sector until 2007, when he resigned from his job to pursue a career as a photographer. In his first solo exhibition, in Mahdia in 2009, Boussoffara explored the graphic, esthetic, and architectural dimensions of photography. After a further solo exhibition in Tunis, he focused on the political changes of the Arab Spring. As a member of the photographers’ collective Dégage, he presented his work in an exhibition and a book bearing witness to a historic moment in the history of his country.

Andrew Quilty,Australia,"Andrew Quilty’s photography career began in Sydney, 2000, on the day his application to a university photo elective was rejected. He quit, and set off around Australia with a surfboard and a Nikon F3 that his uncle—also a photographer—had passed down. Fate further intervened a week into the trip when his van was broken into. Everything but his well-hidden camera, and surfboard, which he was riding at the time, was stolen. 30,000KM later, he enrolled in the Sydney Institute of TAFE's Photography program, finishing at the top of his class in 2004. He was given an informal internship at Fairfax Media which evolved into full-time employment. There, Quilty found himself surrounded by some of Australia's most outstanding photographers. They reshaped his worldview and set him on a course that continues to inspire his work today. He left Fairfax in 2010 and freelanced from Sydney before relocating to New York City in 2012. But it was during a trip to Afghanistan and the Middle East, in 2013, that he first discovered bonafide purpose and fulfilment in his photography. He has been based in Kabul, Afghanistan ever since. His work in Afghanistan has been published worldwide and garnered several awards. He has travelled to more than 20 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces and continues to document the country through pictures and, increasingly, the written word.

Her current film, ‘The Bitter with the Sweet’, is a love story on the verge of madness between a couple who are trying to grow old together. Her personal projects have been supported through grants from Centre National de l’Audiovisuel in Luxembourg, Œuvre Nationale de Secours Grande-Duchesse Charlotte and Stiftung Kulturwerk der VG Bild-Kunst. Her work has been awarded in CPOY, POYi and the VGH-Preis. Lindström studied photojournalism and documentary photography in Hanover, Germany.

Anton Corbijn,none,"It has been more than 40 years since Anton Corbijn, born 1955 in Strijen, discovered photography though his love for music while still at high school in Holland.  He used his father’s camera for his first photos at an open-air concert in 1972. He soon moved from stage photography to portrait photography, but initially only of musicians.  Anton Corbijn moved to London in 1979 to follow his love of music from there and is today widely regarded as one of the most influential photographers both in the world of music and in the world of portraiture photography. An autodidact, he has changed his approach to photography a few times over the years but kept relatively close to his first subject matter: artists in general and specifically musicians.  Some of his most well known photographs feature; Clint Eastwood, Cameron Diaz, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, Naomi Campbell, William S. Burroughs, Tom Waits, Allen Ginsberg, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Robert De Niro, Gerhard Richter, Ai Weiwei, Lucian Freud and is considered to be the ‘house’ photographer of U2 for the last 30 odd years and for Depeche Mode for almost as long. Anton Corbijn is very interested in pushing the boundaries in respect to the media he works in.  He has been working in film and video with some of the musicians he photographed and was in 1983 one of the first photographers to direct music videos. He has since made approximately 80 music videos; for among others U2, Johnny Cash, Arcade Fire, Depeche Mode, Nirvana, Metallica, Nick Cave, Coldplay and The Killers. He also made in 1993 a short film with and about Don van Vliet a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, called “Some Yo Yo Stuff”. His music video work is highly acclaimed and has won him an MTV award for Nirvana’s “Heart Shaped Box”, and a CADS (Creative and Design Awards) award for “outstanding achievement” for his oeuvre in 2005. A Directors series DVD was released by Palm Pictures in the same year. Since 1990, apart from working in photography and video, Anton also worked with graphic design to create logos, posters and CD covers.  Although not conventionally trained in graphic design, he has found his style by painting his own typeface. That way he successfully designed posters and record sleeves for artists like Herbert Grönemeyer and Depeche Mode and designed the logo for the Dutch city The Hague. Anton Corbijn’s exhibitions have been extremely successful in Europe and his work can be seen in museums and galleries alike as well as in 15 published books. His most recent book WAITS/CORBIJN, which was collaboration between Anton and Tom Waits, was sold out from the publisher within a week of publication. In addition his work can be seen on over 100 record/CD sleeves featuring artists like U2, R.E.M., The Bee Gees, Morrissey, The Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker, Bryan Ferry, The Killers, Bruce Springsteen, James Last, JJ Cale, Nick Cave, Depeche Mode and Metallica.  For Depeche Mode he has designed stage-sets as well as the on-stage visuals for all their world tours for the last 20 years. In 2005 Anton Corbijn started working on (directing/co-producing/financing) his first feature film “CONTROL”, which was filmed during the summer of 2006, and released in October 2007.  It was his most ambitious projects to date and a further extension to his versatile artistic career.  The film is a love story about the life, and death, of Ian Curtis, who was Joy Division’s singer.  This subject was very close to Anton’s heart as Joy Division was the reason for why he’d moved from Holland to London as he “wanted to be closer to where their music came from”.  “CONTROL” and Anton as a director won around 20 awards worldwide, including 5 BIFA’s, one of those for Sam Riley as the lead actor. Anton Corbijn has in recent years worked on a new series of portraits of painters, directed a second feature film called “The American” with George Clooney in the lead which occupied the #1 spot in the USA in 2010.  His third feature called “A Most Wanted Man”, based on the novel by John Le Carré featuring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, premiered at the Sundance Festival in 2014, and is as of September 2014 released world-wide to largely amazingly positive reviews.  “LIFE” a feature with Robert Pattinson shot in Canada & USA early last year is due to premiere at this year’s Berlinale. Anton has recently also managed to direct a few commercials i.e. Miss Dior, Volvo and a Depeche Mode live DVD and shot several features for Vogue (USA).  In 2011 he was awarded the highest Dutch Cultural Award, the ‘Prince Bernhard Cultuurfonds Prijs’, for his contribution and influence in the world of the arts. 2015 is set to be a busy year, with several large museums shows scheduled for travel across Europe as a celebration of Anton’s long career.",,,,,,

Arild Kristo,Norway,"Arild Kristo (1939-2010) was a Norwegian photographer and filmmaker, whose small but poignant oeuvre achieved cult status as time passed, encompassing 180 photos, two short films and one feature film. Kristo had his photographic education in the Unites States and worked as a freelance photographer in the U.S. and Europe. In 1962, together with photographers Dan Young (1938) and Robert A. Robinson (1927-1996), he founded photo agency Manité, a name taken from the French word Humanité, which referred to the fundamental idea behind the group's photographic approach: to capture human existence through photography.  Kristo travelled around Europe in 1962. When he came back, he discovered on his negatives a little boy playing in the shadow of the newly erected Berlin Wall. He decided to return in 1963 to make a story about this boy, Manfred Stein, and his life near Checkpoint Charlie. The photo essay about Manfred was published in the American magazine Look in June 1963 and in British and German magazines as well. In 1963, Kristo created the photo series Ten Commandments, in which he used distinct cropping methods, high contrasts and remarkable typography to present his images. Arild Kristo made his debut as a film director in 1966 with the short film Undergrunnen (The Underground) about Oslo's subway. In 1967, he followed with Kristoball, a playful film about a young director's anguishes and problems.

Zola's talent for a good image, was recognized by the paper's management, and in the early 1950s, the Daily Mirror gave him a page called “Life in the Mirror"". Here, he recorded the day to day lives of people who made up Britain. In the 1960s, he covered the rise of the Beatles and the ever changing face of Britain. A few of the events captured by his lens, were the tragic results of the mudslide at Aberfan. The great train robbery, the anti Vietnam war demonstrations in London and the Profumo affair.

Daniel Morel,Haiti,"Daniel Morel was born in Haiti in 1951. The day he discovered photography wasn't the happiest of days, but it set the stage for the rest of his life. It was November 12, 1964, in Port-au Prince. The Haitian government canceled school and people were bussed in from miles around to watch the execution of Louis Drouin and Marcel Numa. The two young men were the last two survivors of a 13-member group that called themselves ‘Jeune Haiti' (Young Haiti). The group had planned to overthrow the regime of Francois ‘Papa Doc' Duvalier. The next day, a photographer who had shot the rebels' deaths frame by frame posted them in the front of his studio. It was a gruesome sight for the young Morel, but it made him realize that he wanted to take pictures too.

Until 2008, he worked mostly in south Italy, covering events and news largely related to the mafia and criminality. His reportage about the Camorra in Naples was published worldwide. At the end of 2008, Castaldo moved to live in Jerusalem, and covered the IDF’s ‘Operation Cast Lead’ on Gaza—from the Israeli Border and from inside the Gaza Strip. In January 2011, he reached Cairo a few hours before the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, and was in Tahrir Square until Mubarak’s resignation. His coverage of the event was published in Time, and worldwide. In May 2011, Castaldo temporarily left the Middle East to work on different projects in Italy. He was on-set photographer for a movie by director Matteo Garrone (winner Grand prix Festival de Cannes 2009), and at the same time covered, under assignment, several news and style events in Italy. In 2012, he moved back to the Middle East, where he’s currently working on projects about political and social issues in Israel, Palestine and Egypt. Castaldo is currently based between Jerusalem, Cairo, and Italy.","{'Voisin', 'Der Spiegel', 'Lewis Hines', 'Alec Soth', 'Olivier Voisin'}",5.0,"{'The Sunday Times Magazine', 'AFP', 'Walker Evans', 'Paris Match'}",4.0,"{'Egypt', 'Turkey', 'Aleppo', 'France', 'Syria', 'Paris', 'Nancy', 'Getty Images'}",8.0

Esther Horvath,Hungary,"Esther Horvath is a documentary photographer, Fellow at the International League of Conservation Photographers, member of The Photo Society and a science photographer for Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany.

Horvath wants to show the full research story behind our climate data: who the scientists that are delivering crucial climate change information are, and how they work and live in the most remote locations and harshest environments on the planet.

Since 2015, after her first assignment in the Arctic Ocean with Audubon Magazine, Horvath has dedicated her photography to the polar regions, especially to the Arctic Ocean, documenting scientific expeditions and behind the scene science stories. She follows the work of multiple science groups that are working to better understand the changing polar regions. By documenting the work and life of scientists who deliver important data, Horvath hopes to help make a difference in how people understand what is actually occurring and, in collaboration with scientists, help raise public awareness regarding these fragile environments.

Begun in 2016, her main long-term documentary project IceBird has followed scientific expeditions investigating the thinning ice cover in the Arctic Ocean.

From 2019 - 2020, she spent almost four months on board the Polarstern icebreaker, documenting the MOSAiC expedition in the Central Arctic Ocean, the largest ever Arctic Ocean science expedition. Her documentary, during polar nights, under the extreme conditions of the North Pole is published in the book Into the Arctic Ice. The book, accompanied by essays and contributions by experts, is a testimony to the biggest climatic challenge of our time, and offers insights into this research project as well as the polar landscape worthy of protection.

Horvath’s work has been featured in National Geographic, The New York Times, Audubon Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, TIME, GEO and Stern among others.

So much is captured of the urban hardships of Brazil but Felipe’s work in the rural environments, which in no way turn a blind eye to the unique hardships that exist there, make him one of the first photographers that come to mind when I think of those whose vision still needs to be seen more by the rest of the viewing and watching world.” – Dan Immel, USA, editor, curator, photographer, and project manager Born in 1982, Felipe Fittipaldi is a Brazilian photographer currently based in Rio de Janeiro.

Passion for photography has always been part of his life, although at the beginning he could not afford to buy a decent camera and instead was experimenting with polaroids and vintage models, such as the old Yashica that his granny found at the pension where she used to work. After a few months in the UK, he enrolled in a photography BFA at LCC, which helped him to organize everything he had learned as a self-taught photographer. Newly graduated, the mandatory national service called him back to his native Italy. After one year spent serving his country and two more on the road in Europe, he got a job with a major airline, which drastically increased his chances to travel worldwide. He eventually fell in love with documentary photography and over a decade of voyaging, he was able to produce a body of work covering several topics. Currently Giovanni, also a graduate of the Loyalist College Photojournalism Program (Dean's List), lives between Toronto and Montreal with his wife and daughter. His independent work explores multiple issues across North America and the world, focusing on unique and intimate stories that often go unnoticed. Giovanni's clients list and publications include: United Nations High Commissioner Refugees (UNHCR), Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, MacLean's Magazine, Canadian Press, Montreal Gazette & Postmedia Network newspapers such as National Post, Ottawa Citizen, Vancouver Sun, Edmonton Journal, The Province and Saskatoon StarPhoenix, former Sun Media/QMI Agency, Manitoulin Expositor, Manitoulin Recorder, Metro Rome and NGOs the likes of Ontario HIV Treatment Network and Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network.","{'Gerry Badger', 'Martin Parr', 'Giorgio Di Noto', 'Fotografia Adams'}",4.0,{'the Sapienza University of Rome'},1.0,"{'Giorgio', 'Italy', 'Rome'}",3.0

Goran Tomasevic,Serbia,"Tomasevic's award-winning pictures of wars and revolutions have become some of the most enduring images of the conflicts fought in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. His broad work includes photographic features from South Sudan, Pakistan, Mozambique, DR Congo Central African Republic, Burundi, Nigeria and sports coverage of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. After photographing the wars that followed the break-up of former Yugoslavia for a local paper, in 1996 Tomasevic joined Reuters, covering the simmering political tensions in Kosovo and the anti-Milosevic demonstrations in his hometown of Belgrade. During NATO's three-month bombardment of Serbia in 1999, Tomasevic was the only photographer working for foreign press to spend the duration of the conflict in Kosovo. Tomasevic moved to Jerusalem in 2002, covering the second Palestinian intifada. During the U.S. led invasions of Iraq in 2003, his picture of a U.S. Marine watching the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue became one of the most memorable images of the war. He often returned to Iraq as sectarian violence escalated and regularly photographed America's other war in Afghanistan. His sequence of photographs of U.S. Marine Sergeant Bee narrowly escaping Taliban bullets became an iconic image in U.S. war history. Tomasevic moved to Cairo in 2006 and was at the heart of Reuters' coverage of the Arab Springs. In Libya, his image of a fireball that spewed up after an air strike on pro Gaddafi fighters became an iconic image of the Libyan war, gracing the front pages of more than 100 newspapers around the globe. Tomasevic's raw pictures of rebel fighters battling pro-Assad forces among the ruins of Aleppo and Damascus have won international acclaim, as did his coverage of the bloody siege on a Nairobi shopping mall in Kenya. Tomasevic's work has been recognised with many prestigious international awards. He has been named Reuters Photographer of the Year a record four times (2003, 2005, 2011 and 2013) and won the Reuters' Photograph of the Year award in 2008. In 2014, he was awarded first prize in the Spot News Stories category at the World Press Photo and second and third prize ""News Picture Story"" at POYi. He won China International Press Photo of the Year in 2011 and he has been awarded for a spot news in 2004 and 2012. In 2009 he won the SOPA Award of Excellence for News Photography. In 2012 Tomasevic won the London Frontline Club Award and in 2013 the Days Japan award. In 2005 he got the National Press Photography Association, Best of Photojournalism in the Portrait and Personality category and third place for news in 2011. In 2014 he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography. The Guardian's photo team chose Goran Tomasevic as their agency photographer of the year for 2013. International Business Times UK chose Goran as their agency photographer of the year for 2016. In 2012 the Czech Photo Gallery in Prague held a six-week exhibition of Tomasevic's war photography, depicting more than two decades of conflict. Further exhibitions were held in Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents Club in 2014 and Perpignan, France during the Visa pour l’Image festival in 2006, 2013 and 2015.

Guillem Valle,Spain,"Guillem Valle first became interested in documentary photography in 1998, when, at the age of 14, he traveled to Sarajevo on an art-student exchange program. Finding himself with a borrowed camera in the middle of a war-torn city, he began to intuit how powerful photography could not only be a visual language, but a document too. At the age of 16, he started work as a freelance photographer, mainly for local newspapers. While a student at the Institut d'Estudis Fotogràfics de Catalunya, he traveled on two occasions between 2002 and 2003 to photograph the Palestinian Intifada.

Guy Martin,UK,"Guy Martin graduated with a first class B.A(HONS) in Documentary Photography from the University of Wales, Newport in 2006. Guy began pursuing long term personal documentary projects while studying at Newport, one of which, ‘Trading over the Borderline’- a documentation of the border region between Turkey and Northern Iraq and its trade routes – won him the Guardian and Observer Hodge Award for young photographers. Inspired by regions that are in periods of transition, he went on to pursue a long term project on the re- birth of the Cossack movement and Russian nationalism in Southern Russia and the Caucasus from 2005 to 2007, which culminated in the documentation of the Russian/Georgia conflict in August 2008. From January 2011 he began to document the revolutions sweeping through the Middle East and North Africa, photographing the revolution in Egypt before documenting the civil war in Libya from the east to the besieged western city of Misrata in April 2011. His work has appeared in the Guardian, Observer, Sunday Times, The Daily Telegraph, Der Spiegel, D Magazine, FADER Magazine, Monocle Magazine, Huck Magazine, The British Journal of Photography, ARTWORLD, The NewStatesman, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Newsweek Japan, Harpers, Le Monde Dagens Næringsliv - D2/Magasinet and Time.  In 2011 he became an associate lecturer in Press and Editorial Photography program at the University of Falmouth, UK. In 2012 his work from Egypt and Libya formed the basis for joint exhibitions at the Spanish Cultural Centre in New York, HOST Gallery in London, the Third Floor Gallery in Cardiff and the SIDE Gallery in Newcastle. He had his first solo show “Shifting Sands” at the Poly Gallery in Falmouth in January 2012. His work on Libya’s missing formed the basis for a newspaper print book published by HerePress and was distributed for free on the London Underground tube network.  Since 2012 he has been based in Istanbul Turkey, where he is beginning a new long term project on the ebb and flow of Turkish power and influence. Frustrated by the limitations, preconceptions and cliché’s that confront photographers working in the middle east, Guy began a long term look into how blending work from the scenes of soap operas, and the daily violent struggle for the streets of Istanbul can work and interact with one another. The first part of this project, “City of Dreams” chapters 1 & 2 were exhibited as part of the 2nd PhotoReporter Festival in St.Brieuc, France in October 2013 – it has also been selected as a finalist entry in the Sony World Photography Awards 2014 and won the 2nd FIPCOMM award for economic stories 2014. City of dreams is also exhibiting as part of the finalist’s exhibition for the LensCulture photography awards 2014 and has been recognized with a Emergency grant in 2015 to continue with a new phase in the project.

Heinz Kluetmeier,USA,"Born in Berlin, Germany, but raised from the age of nine in Milwaukee in the USA, Heinz Kluetmeier was bitten by the photo bug at an early age. At 15, he was already shooting pictures for The Associated Press, capturing such people as Vince Lombardi, Paul Hornung, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. After high school, he was offered a full-time job as a photographer with the AP, but opted to study engineering. Throughout his college career, Kluetmeier continued shooting for the Milwaukee Journal and The Associated Press. After graduating in 1966, he worked for a year as an engineer, but it was not long before the lure of photography got the better of him. After a brief stint at the Milwaukee Journal as a staff photographer, Kluetmeier became a contract and then staff photographer for Time, Inc. where he shot for both Sports Illustrated and Life magazines. He has since shot over 125 covers for Sports Illustrated and twice served as director of photography. Kluetmeier is probably best known for his 1980 ‘Miracle on Ice' cover, and his underwater image of Michael Phelps at the determining moment he won the 100m butterfly during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.",,,,,,

Jan Dago,Denmark,"Jan Dago was born and grew up in Denmark, where a childhood interest in visual expression began. At first, he made short movies, but the power of the still image gripped him more. Eventually, photojournalism—particularly that exploring the human aspect in a story—became his main focus.
	 
	During the 1980s, Dago continued with photography, while working at a variety of jobs, from serving in a camera shop to cleaning slaughterhouses at night. As his work improved, he became an assistant in an advertising photography studio. In 1990, he became an apprentice at Jyllands-Posten, and worked at the newspaper for the next five years. In 1994, Dago turned freelance, in order to concentrate on more in-depth projects, returning to work as a newspaper staff photographer after ten years. His photos have been published in a wide number of international magazines, and he is currently employed at Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, Denmark’s leading newspaper, where his work involves a variety of assignments, both in Denmark and abroad.","{'James Wellford', 'Darkness Visible', 'Seamus Murphy'}",3.0,"{'Newsweek', 'Projections of Reality', 'Gallery', 'Wellford', 'the Overseas Press Club', 'World Press Photo'}",6.0,"{'New York City', 'Afghanistan', 'Moscow', 'New York'}",4.0
Jan Grarup,Denmark,"Grarup’s work reflects his belief in photojournalism’s role as an instrument of witness and memory to incite change, and the necessity of telling the stories of people who are rendered powerless to tell their own. His images of the Rwandan and Darfur genocides provide incontrovertible evidence of unthinkable human brutality, in the hope that such events will never happen or be allowed to happen again. His work, The Boys from Ramallah and The Boys from Hebron, covers both sides of the Intifada expressed through the lives of children coming of age amidst the violence. Grarup’s work takes the viewer to the limits of human despair, dignity, suffering and hope. His images are relevant to us all, because they form a chronicle of the time in which we live, but at times do not dare to recognize. Grarup has been honored with many of the most prestigious awards from the photography industry and human rights organizations, including: Eight World Press Photo awards, UNICEF, W. Eugene Smith Foundation for Humanistic Photography, Oskar Barnack award,  POYi and NPPA. In 2005, he was awarded with a Visa d’Or at the Visa Pour l’Image photo festival in France, for his coverage of Darfur’s refugee crisis.

During the 12 years he was in the Middle East, he was able to travel around the region reporting on the many conflicts taking place in those years, events like Arafat or Hafez Al Asaad’s deaths or the financial crisis in Dubai. He was among the four journalists who stayed inside Najaf (Iraq) holy mosque until the last days of the siege carried out by US army (2004) and who continued to travel independently to that country to report during the years of regular kidnappings.

Madeyski explored a whole range of photographic disciplines. With his emotions as fuel, he seeks what is intense and essential, in himself as well as his clients.

From 1990 to 1994 he covered the transition in South Africa from apartheid to democracy. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kadir covered social issues in different corners of the former empire. In 1997 he embarked on a big project to travel along the seven rivers of the world, from source to mouth, covering daily life along these lifelines. The project resulted in the book ‘Rivers’ and ‘Aderen’ (Mets & Schilt). Kadir has received numerous prizes and awards in photojournalism. In 2000 and 2002 Kadir was a jury member of the World Press Photo contest and is currently on the supervisory board of the World Press Photo foundation. In 2004 he went back to Angola, Sierra Leone and the DR of Congo to portray the diamond industry, following the diamonds from the mines to the consumer markets in the western world. The resulting exhibitions were shown in Europe and the USA, and also in the mining areas of Congo, Angola and Sierra Leone. The photo book ‘Diamond Matters, the diamond industry’ was published by Mets & Schilt (Holland), Dewi Lewis (UK) and Umbrage editions (USA) and awarded the prestigious Dutch Dick Scherpenzeel Prize for best reporting on the developing world. The project was also recognized with a World Press Photo Award.

After the Second World War, in 1945, he became a photojournalist for Life and worked in Congo and the Middle-East before going to Vietnam. He arrived first in Vietnam in 1962. When the war broke out he decided to stay to cover the conflict. He died on 10 February 1971, when his helicopter was shot down over Laos. Also on board were fellow photojournalists Henri Huet, Kent Potter and Keisaburo Shimamoto, who died as well. Burrows was an extraordinary talented and brave war photographer, by whom others measured themselves. American journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner David Halberstam, who was in Vietnam with Burrows, wrote in the book Requiem: By the Photographers Who Died in Vietnam and Indochina (1997): 'I must mention Larry Burrows in particular. To us younger men who had not yet earned reputations, he was a sainted figure. He was a truly beautiful man, modest, graceful, a star who never behaved like one. He was generous to all, a man who gave lessons to his colleagues not just on how to take photographs but, more important, on how to behave like a human being, how to be both colleague and mentor. Our experience of the star system in photography was, until we met him, not necessarily a happy one; all too often talent and ego seemed to come together in equal amounts. We were touched by Larry: How could someone so talented be so graceful?'",,,,,,

Massoud Hossaini,Afghanistan,"Massoud Hossaini was born in Kabul in 1981, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. His father’s opposition to the Afghan communist regime meant the family had to flee the country, to Iran, when Hossaini was six months old. After finishing high school in 1996, Hossaini joined the Iranian reformist movement as a political activist. After a while, he realized that he should be recording the historical events that were going on around him, and chose photography as the means of doing so.

	As a refugee himself, it was too difficult and dangerous to risk photographing in the streets of Iran, so he decided to focus on fellow Afghans sheltering in Iran. He was documenting the life of refugees in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city, when the events of 11 September 2001 changed his direction completely. Hossaini decided to go back to Afghanistan, at the beginning of 2002, where he joined Aina, an organization aimed at training people in media and communication skills, founded by National Geographic Fellow and photojournalist, Reza Deghati. He learned his photography skills from Reza’s brother, Manoocher Deghati, and was soon being given professional assignments. Hossaini joined Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2007, and covered the war in Afghanistan, part of the time embedded with US troops. In doing this, he traveled to isolated villages, where he also documented local life. Hossaini’s work has twice been exhibited in Berlin, and he is currently still an AFP photographer in Afghanistan.",,,,,,

Max Pam,Australia,"Max Pam is passionate about life, travel and photography -- for him they are inseparable. Travel has been the catalyst for the creation of his compelling images since the 1960s and the images he has produced providing an intimate journal of his life. As a teenager Pam found post-war suburban Melbourne grim, oppressive and culturally isolated. He found refuge in the counter-culture of surfing and the imagery of National Geographic and Surfer magazine and became determined to travel overseas.  Pam left Australia at 20, after accepting a job as a photographer assisting an astrophysicist. Together, the pair drove a Volkswagen from Calcutta to London. This adventure proved inspirational and travel has remained a crucial and continuous link to Pam's creative and personal development. Pam's work takes the viewer on compelling journeys around the globe.  His extensive work in Asian counties is well represented in major collections and books as are his travels in Europe and Australia and into the rich and diverse Indian Ocean Rim cultures including India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Yemen, The Republic of Tanzania, Mauritius, Madagascar, the Cocos and Christmas Islands. These images leave the viewer, as Tim Winton said in Pam’s award-winning book Going East, “...grateful for having been taken so mysteriously by surprise and so far and sweetly abroad.”  His book Going East was featured in Phaidon’s History of the Photobook Vol 2 in 2006. His prints are in national and private collections in Australia, France, Great Britain Italy and Japan. Some of the published books on Max Pam’s work include: Max Pam (1999), Ethiopia (1999), and Indian Ocean Journals (2000).

In 2012, when the Syrian Revolution started, the regime ripped him away from his life, his university studies in architecture, and any chance of leaving Douma in Eastern Ghouta, where he lived under seige for the past seven years.

It was while Badra worked as a first aid responder that he started to take his first pictures as an amateur photographer. It wasn’t until the chemical attack on Ghouta in 2013, when he witnessed a horrific atrocity, that he realized the power that photographs have to capture humanity and history.

That year, he started sending pictures for Reuters as a freelance photographer, and in 2015 Badra started working with EPA as a staff photographer based in Douma.

In 2016, he was awarded Young Photographer of the Year in the Prix Bayeux-Calvados War Correspondents Competition. The same year, he was named Time Magazine’s Wire Photographer of the Year for 2016, and won 3rd prize in UNICEF’s Photo of the Year.

In 2018, he received the Marco Luchetta Award for Photography, 1st place in News/Events of IPPAWARDS, and second place in News pictures story of Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar. In April 2018, Badra was forcibly displaced from his home in Douma to Idlib, and eventually left Syria for Turkey.

Omar Victor Diop,Senegal,"Omar Victor Diop is a visual artist and photographer based in Dakar, Senegal.

Omar Victor Diop was born in Dakar in 1980. From his early days, he developed an interest for photography and design, essentially as a means to capture the diversity of modern African societies and lifestyles.

The quick success of his first conceptual project Fashion 2112: Le Futur du Beau, which was featured at the Pan African Exhibition of the African Biennale of Photography of 2011 in Bamako (Rencontres de Bamako), encouraged him to end his career in corporate communications to dedicate to photography in 2012.

Omar Victor Diop’s body of work includes fine arts and fashion photography as well as advertising photography. He enjoys mixing his photography with other forms of art, such as costume design, styling and creative writing. This is particularly visible in the series Studio des Vanités (2013), in which he follows his research between photography and design, with a strong influence from African portraitists. His project Diaspora (2014) is a time travel, a journey that takes its starting point in the present, focusing on the issue of immigration of African people in Europe and their place in European society. His latest series Liberty (2017) recalls, interprets and juxtaposes moments of Black protests differentiated by time, geography or size, placing them in the same chronology, that of a frantic quest for freedom.

Paolo Verzone,Italy,"For almost 30 years, Paolo Verzone has been photographing the world around him. At his beginnings, he covers the news as it appears in the pages of European and international magazines: a world in perpetual motion, ever so changing, which he observes with the distance of those not bound to the emergency of the moment. With rigor and eclecticism, he goes from news assignments to long term projects, from embedded documentary stories to posed portraits. From black and white to color, as well, and finally from analog to digital. Over time, his interest of the world is drawn more and more towards its people. He develops demanding sets of photographs made with a medium format view camera, that imposes a focus on the subject, presented full-length. Whether it is a set of portraits of Europeans at the beach, Seeuropeans (1994 / 2002), or the Moscow Project (1991 / 2011), produced in collaboration with Alessandro Albert, the sum of the people photographed reflect upon the multiplicity and singularity of each individual. With his project on the cadets of the main European military academies, started in 2009, Paolo Verzone maps us contemporary Europe through a part of its youth, while questioning the European identity.  Paolo Verzone was awarded at World Press Photo in 2000, 2009, and 2015. His photographs are part of different collections at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and the Instituto Nazionale della Grafica, in Rome.","{'Paolo Pellegrin', 'Kunstfoyer', 'Double Blind', 'an Olivier Rebbot Award', 'a Leica Medal', 'W.

In 2004, Woods published the book American Chaos, a detailed reportage on western involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. Both books have been published in France and Italy, and as magazine pieces in over ten different countries. In 2007 and 2008, Woods documented the rise of Chinese influence in Africa.

The work has been acclaimed as the most thorough investigation of the phenomenon, and as an exemplary encounter between fine art and documentary photography. In 2010, Woods completed the project Walk on my Eyes, an intimate portrait of the Iranian society. The resulting book was published in France and has been translated into German, Spanish and Persian. The associated exhibition premiered at the Festival of Arles in France, and is currently touring worldwide.

In 1989, he began his career as a photographer in Thailand while making his first underwater photos on the reefs around the Similan Island with a borrowed camera. The first results were a disaster from today's perspective, but he quickly became determined to improve. Not long after he returned to Germany, he acquired his first underwater camera. He then began spending his time in lakes across Germany and Austria, always with the camera at his side. Dirscherl has regularly won prizes for his work, which has opened the door to numerous international magazines, advertising agencies and photo agencies. In order to keep his ‘photographic back' free, Dirscherl sells his digital work through the photo agency Waterframe, founded by his wife Daniela Dirscherl, and their partner agents. This enables him to concentrate fully on his photography and affords him the luxury now and then to test a different visual language or edit a photographic theme that is not currently accepted by the media, but maybe will be in the near future.","{'Reem Maged', 'Atfal al Mahjar'}",2.0,"{'Al Jezeera News', 'ONA Academy', 'Cairo University', 'Nile TV', 'Al Jazeera Children'}",5.0,{'Egypt'},1.0

Rena Effendi,Azerbaijan,"Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, Rena Effendi is an award winning documentary photographer focusing on issues of conflict, social justice and the environment. She is currently based in Istanbul, Turkey. 

From 2002 to 2008, Effendi followed a 1,700-kilometer pipeline through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey documenting the impact this multibillion-dollar project had on impoverished farmers, fishermen, and other citizens. This six-year journey became her first monograph Pipe Dreams: A Chronicle of Lives Along the Pipeline, published in 2009. The project received numerous awards, including a Getty Images Editorial grant. 

In 2012, Effendi published her second monograph Liquid Land, where her images of Baku are paired with photographs of perished butterflies hunted by her father, a Soviet entomologist, who collected more than 30,000 butterflies in the Soviet Union. Liquid Land punctuates the theme of fragility and environmental decay of her native city.  

Over the past two decades, Effendi has photographed human interest stories around the world, working frequently as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine. In 2011, she received the Prince Claus Fund Award for Cultural Development. In the words of the awards committee, two qualities pervade Effendi’s photography: a deep sense of empathy and a quiet celebration of the strength of the human spirit. Effendi was twice short-listed for the Prix-Pictet Global Award for Photography and Sustainability. In 2020, Effendi’s work for the Wall Street Journal received two awards from the Overseas Press Club of America. Rena Effendi is a member of the Cultural Leadership network of the World Economic Forum.

His interest in photography began during his last years of high school and led to studies at the Istituto Superiore di Fotografia in Rome. His career as a photojournalist began in the late 1980s, covering mainly national and European news and events, and such themes as immigration and student activism. A personal research project on the city of Naples, and an investigation-dossier into the scandal surrounding the Irpinia Earthquake Fund, led to a series of publications in leading Italian magazines and newspapers. Over the 1990s he broadened his field of interest to a more international focus. Projects included a reportage on conditions in Albania after the communist era, an investigation of child prostitution in Thailand, and of Nazi skinheads in Germany. In the mid 1990s his attention was mainly drawn towards countries in conflict. Work on Afghanistan won a World Press Photo prize in 1997, and in 1999 Venturi was awarded a Leica Honorable Mention for reporting the war in Kosovo. His coverage of conflict zones has also taken him to Sierra Leone, Burundi, Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda. He has also covered significant international events, such as the tsunami in Sri Lanka and in Indonesia, and the earthquake that struck Iran in 2004. Currently, Venturi alternates between international news and personal projects. He often works in collaboration with humanitarian agencies, such as the World Health Organization, with whom he has been working over the past two years on a project about tuberculosis worldwide. A project on work-related deaths and disability-causing accidents became a book, as did one focusing on Middle-Eastern identity. Venturi joined Contrasto in 2001. In 2007 he was given the UCSI award, and in 2008 won the Marco Luchetta award.","{'Human Rights Watch', 'Rory Peck', 'Der Spiegel', 'Award', 'Paris Match', 'Die Welt', 'Ricardo Garcia Vilanova'}",7.0,"{'The Wall Street Journal', 'Euronews', 'United Nations', 'Vilanova', 'ISIS', 'The Washington Post', 'Le Monde, Liberation', 'Channel 4', 'International Photography Awards', 'The New York Times', 'National Press Photographers Association (NPPA', 'POY', 'CNN', 'BBC', 'IPA', 'World Press Photo Involvement', 'PBS', 'Guardian', 'Mika Yamamoto International', 'LensCulture', 'Newsweek', 'Japan International', 'Aljazeera', 'the International Press Club', 'Time', 'the International Committee of the Red Cross'}",26.0,"{'Stern', 'Life'}",2.0

He was in 8th grade when the peaceful uprising started in 2011, but slowly the demonstrations spread and reached his hometown of Douma. His older siblings started documenting the events and uploading videos to the Internet and, as the conflict intensified, he began to help them. In the middle of 2012, the Syrian regime forces besieged Douma from all sides and began attacking it. The shelling and bombing prevented him from getting to school on the day of his final exams and caused him to fail that year. Security circumstances prevented him from attending school for a whole year, but he eventually managed to continue high school. For three years, he put his life in danger by filming what was happening for a local publication. He gained a lot of experience, though, and journalism became his passion and interest. In 2014, he became interested in photography and started browsing the Internet for tutorials to learn more.

Sarah Waiswa,Uganda ,"Sarah Waiswa is a Ugandan photographer, living and working between Kampala, Uganda and Nairobi, Kenya.

She was a second year fellow at the Goethe Institut's Photographers Master Class (Nairobi, Kenya 2017 and Johannesburg, South Africa 2018). In 2015, she was awarded first place in the Story and Creative categories of the Uganda Press Photo Awards and second place in the Daily Life and Portrait categories.

In 2018, she was named a Canon Brand Ambassador and was selected for the World Press Photo 6x6 Africa Program. 

A storyteller, Sarah Waiswa’s work focuses on identity – particularly the New African Identity – and explores themes around isolation and belonging. By applying a poetic and often metaphorical language, she hopes to challenge the gaze of the viewer by creating compositions or settings that generate tranquil poetic images that leave traces and balance on the edge of recognition and alienation. 

Her work has been exhibited around the world, most recently at the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and as part of the group show ""African Mētrópolis. An Imaginary city"" at the National Museum of the 21st Century Arts in Rome.

Sin Luz: Life Without Power team,none,"As the longest power outage in U.S. history stretched on for months, the three pitched returning to the island a few months later to report on life without electricity. To create a story that had visual impact and emotional power, senior producer for video Reem Akkad, graphics director Kat Downs and senior editor at-large Ann Gerhart pulled together a team of 18 from across the newsroom to build an immersive multimedia experience. That early collaboration allowed writers, videographers, designers and developers to work fluidly together on the storytelling. Murphy worked in Puerto Rico’s mountainous region of Utuado to report on and film a teacher, nurse, and family living without electricity or running water. Leaming went to the coastal town of Yabucoa and brought back the stories of a small business owner and struggling student. Hernandez, who has relatives in Puerto Rico, dug into local reports of desperation to find characters and played the vital role of putting each individual story into the larger context.  © Edwin Avila The Washington Post’s Jorge Ribas and Seth Blanchard filmed dramatic drone footage of landscapes and mudslides. They then worked with Kolin Pope to render 3D models with photogrammetry, an innovative technology that offers audiences a new perspective on the devastation. Designer and developer Emily Yount lead the interactive’s design and Armand Emamdjomeh and Lauren Tierney built beautiful maps and graphics to provide crucial context to the story. Joanne Lee and Victoria Fogg designed icons, and Paula Duran Rehbien was critical in producing quickly a Spanish-language version of the project. The team also included freelancers Hector Santos Guia, Joa Rodriguez, and Mardelis Jusino Ortiz.","{'Laura Poitras', 'Meghna Singh', 'Simon Wood', 'Charlotte Cooke', 'Best Mini Doc', 'Container'}",6.0,"{'Social Media', '@wanderingsimon', 'the Final Cut', 'the International Documentary Film Festival', 'Untamed', 'Academy', 'IDFA', 'IFP', 'Documentaries for Independent Film Week', 'Field of Vision', '@shadydocumentarian', 'Orbis'}",12.0,"{'Beijing', 'Dry City', 'South Africa', 'Cape Town', 'New York City', 'Montana'}",6.0

Terrell Groggins,United States ,"Terrell Groggins is known domestically and internationally for his compelling coverage of boxing and social injustice in Detroit, MI, United States. His observant understanding of the human condition informs his vision of the African diaspora. Beyond photography, he dedicates significant time to developing his filmmaking career as a director.

Since 2008, Groggins has worked as a financial advisor for educators in Michigan and is a pillar in the community mentoring youth. His compassion and commitment to young people are deeply rooted in growing up in a single-parent home but living on a block where everyone looked out for each other. His mother and grandmother, Edna, raised him to the best of their abilities, but when family was not present, it was the local neighborhood of grounded men that filled in to make sure he wouldn’t fail in life.

Groggins' journey to becoming a photographer began with his neighbor’s mother, a Japanese foreign language teacher, who showed him a worldlier perspective outside of Detroit.

In 2012, desperate to find value in life after years of grieving his younger brother’s death in 2008, he picked up a camera and found joy, passion, and the fulfillment he had been searching for his whole life through photography. Groggins learned he could be involved in the things that were important to him (education, empowerment, activism, inspiring and motivating others, history, and also creating art, fashion, travel, meeting new people, and working for himself).

A self-taught photographer with no former training, he has catapulted from an unfamiliar name to being sought after for his signature photographic style. In 2012, he founded the photography company and brand My Art My Rules.

The Waypoint team,none,"To help expose the humanitarian plight to its readers, The Washington Post sent a small team of multi-platform journalists to explore innovative ways to bring audiences greater insight into their ordeal. Samuel Granados, senior graphics editor, led the team’s effort to create a digital narrative that would immerse the viewer in the journey and peril experienced by those refugees and migrants. Zoeann Murphy, a video journalist who had spent more than a decade documenting refugee issues, led the video storytelling effort. And London bureau chief, Griff Witte, who had previously reported on the unfolding events on Lesbos, led the print narrative focusing on the island and its dynamics.

	Together they gathered a wide range of conventional and non-conventional visuals and testimonials from families, aid organizations, and locals on the island. In addition to filming, photographing, writing, and recording natural sounds, they gathered materials made by the refugees and migrants themselves including photographs, illustrations and cell phone footage.

	Back in Washington DC, the team worked together to shape the story and design the interactive. Kevin Schaul, an award-winning visual journalist well versed in digital design, built the backend of the pioneering new storytelling platform, where the user can choose the depth of his own experience in the story. Kat Downs, Washington Post’s graphics director, and Emily Chow, assignment editor, edited the piece.

He was the first AP photographer to cover the military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in 2002 he traveled to Kandahar to photograph families of the Guantánamo inmates. Tomas left AP in 2003 to concentrate on large-scale personal projects, starting with the Maoist rebellion in Nepal.

He was awarded an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 2008, and in 2010 he was named the POYi Photographer of the Year.

Ton Koene,the Netherlands,"Ton Koene (48) holds a degree in humanitarian practice from Oxford University. After graduating in 1989, he worked for sixteen years for Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF), primarily as Head of Mission in twelve conflict areas, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia, Chechnya, Angola and Sudan. He was responsible for all humanitarian operations in these countries.Koene found himself increasingly drawn to photography and missed creativity in the humanitarian world. In 2006, he resigned from MSF and began working as a freelance photojournalist. He continued traveling to (post-) conflict countries, exchanging the syringe for a camera. His photo documentaries have covered such topics as prostitution in Nigeria, coal mining in Bulgaria, malnutrition in Somalia, genocide in Darfur, and the Inuits of the North Pole. Humanitarianism has always been the main focus of his features.Koene’s photos have been published in many international magazines and newspapers, and his photo archives are represented by agencies over the world. Since starting as a professional photographer, Koene has produced five photo books and one textbook (about how to survive in dangerous countries).Koene is an autodidact photographer. In his opinion, a keen eye, a passion for photography and knowing how to deal with people are the most important ingredients for success—technique is overrated. Since January 2010, Koen has been  based in Afghanistan as a freelance photographer for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant.",,,,,,

Veronica Cordeiro,Brazil,"Veronica Cordeiro is a Brazilian artist, curator and writer based in Montevideo, Uruguay. 

Her approach to making, curating and teaching photography emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research. One of Cordeiro’s key interests is to study people’s behavioral relationship with photography, in order to promote greater awareness of its uses as well as possibilities.

She recently completed her first biographic novel based on the life of a Brazilian drug dealer who discovers art in prison and undergoes a profound process of growth and transformation, later becoming one of the most inspiring community leaders of São Paulo. In 2021, Cordeiro founded Tierra Art Platform, a space that gives visibility to art, photography and thought processes connected to nature and sustainability in Latin America.

Vincent Laforet,France/USA,"Vincent Laforet, a three-time winner at the prestigious 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, is a director and Pulitzer Prize–winning photographer who is known for his forward-thinking approach to image-making and storytelling. In addition to having been commissioned by just about every important international publication—including Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, National Geographic, Sports Illustrated, Time, Newsweek and Life — Laforet is considered a pioneer both for his innovative tilt-shift and aerial photography and in the field of HD-capable DSLR cameras. In fact, his short film Reverie, the first 1080p video shot with a still camera, was seen by more than 2 million times on the first week of its release in 2009. Laforet, who was born in 1975, began his photography career at the age of 15. He started as a photojournalist, honing his abilities by landing internships with newspapers such as The Los Angeles Times and with Reuters. By the time he was 25, he had established himself as the youngest staff photographer for The New York Times and, by the time he left, he had a Pulitzer for feature photography under his belt. “His images stir with life,” PDN wrote of him in a 2003 “One to Watch” profile. “Athletes are colorful heroes ripped from comic book pages while his wartime photographs successfully wander between the unimaginably large scale and the touchingly human.” In 2005, American Photo named him one of the '100 Most Influential People in Photography,' and his work has been recognized in the Communication Arts and PDN annuals and by the World Press Photo Awards, the Pictures of the Year Competition, the Overseas Press Club, the National Headliners Awards and the Pro-Football Hall of Fame, among others. In June 2010, he was honored with a Gold, Silver, and a Bronze in the Titanium category at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival for his work as the director on the groundbreaking Canon 'Beyond the Still' competition, which he spearheaded with Grey Advertising. “It’s not just the laundry list of awards that sets Laforet apart, though,” noted The FStop magazine in a 2010 interview with Laforet, whose fine-art prints have been exhibited worldwide and are part of numerous private collections. “It’s his steady and unique growth as a photographer. From shooting weddings [as a teen] to the NBA finals in college to his job at the Times and now his much publicized move to commercial photography and motion work, it’s been a long and fruitful evolution.” Since 2006, Laforet himself has charted this evolution on his blog, which has become a must read in the photographic and filmmaking communities, attracting more than 3,000,000 visitors each year. His combination of candor and expertise have made him highly sought after as a consultant (for companies such as Apple, Canon, Manfrotto, Lexar, X-Rite, and Zeiss), a keynote speaker and an instructor. Laforet, who has been profiled on CNN, Good Morning America and in dozens of publications, has served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and at the International Center of Photography. He is represented by the New York–based agency Stockland Martel and resides in Manhattan Beach, California, with his wife, Amber, son Noah and daughter Eliana.
